<meta name="citation_abstract" content="AUD remains a prevalent, lasting and costly problem in the United States, yet few receive treatment due to barriers. Smart Digital Therapeutics (DTx) are emerging as a promising tool to address these barriers. They can potentially provide continuous risk monitoring and individualized support through personal sensing and algorithms. This study leverages SMS messages both three days and one week preceding a lapse episode to predict next-day alcohol lapse. We recruited 138 participants (65 males; 121 Whites non-Hispanic) in early recovery with a goal of abstinence. Self-reported alcohol use and text messages were obtained during a 3-month period. We enginnered features from LIWC and trained models with XGBoost. We used grouped, nested cross-validation to select the best model configuration. The median auROC was .53 (95% CI [.52, .54]) for the best model across the 300 folds in the inner loop. Our model performed consistently worse for people from different underprivileged groups. We further calculated SHAP values and discovered that social processes, social behaviors and second person pronoun emerge as the most important features. Our study suggests that the LIWC model fails to capture sufficient signal from SMS messages to be clinically useful. Our next step is to use other natural language processing methods to do feature engineering and compare the results with this baseline LIWC model. Future studies should also consider other data sources to improve model performance.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Availability of Medications for the Treatment of Alcohol and Opioid Use Disorder in the USA;,citation_abstract=Despite high mortality rates due to opioid overdose and excessive alcohol consumption, medications for the treatment of alcohol and opioid use disorder have not been widely used in the USA. This paper provides an overview of the literature on the availability of alcohol and opioid used disorder medications in the specialty substance use disorder treatment system, other treatment settings and systems, and among providers with a federal waiver to prescribe buprenorphine. We also present the most current data on the availability of alcohol and opioid use disorder medications in the USA. These estimates show steady growth in availability of opioid use disorder medications over the past decade and a decline in availability of alcohol use disorder medications. However, overall use of medications in the USA remains low. In 2017, only 16.3% of specialty treatment programs offered any single medication for alcohol use disorder treatment and 35.5% offered any single medication for opioid use disorder treatment. Availability of buprenorphine-waivered providers has increased significantly since 2002. However, geographic disparities in access to buprenorphine remain. Some of the most promising strategies to increase availability of alcohol and opioid use disorder medications include the following: incorporating substance use disorder training in healthcare education programs, educating the substance use disorder workforce about the benefits of medication treatment, reducing stigma surrounding the use of medications, implementing medications in primary care settings, implementing integrated care models, revising regulations on methadone and buprenorphine, improving health insurance coverage of medications, and developing novel medications for the treatment of substance use disorder.;,citation_author=Amanda J.

Information in the clinical notes of the electronic health record of trauma patients may be used for phenotyping tasks with natural language processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning. The objective of this study is to train and validate an NLP classifier for identifying patients with alcohol misuse.An observational cohort of 1422 adult patients admitted to a trauma center between April 2013 and November 2016. Linguistic processing of clinical notes was performed using the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System. The primary analysis was the binary classification of alcohol misuse. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test served as the reference standard.The data corpus comprised 91 045 electronic health record notes and 16 091 features. In the final machine learning classifier, 16 features were selected from the first 24 hours of notes for identifying alcohol misuse. The classifier’s performance in the validation cohort had an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.85). Sensitivity and specificity were at 56.0% (95% CI, 44.1% to 68.0%) and 88.9% (95% CI, 84.4% to 92.8%). The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test demonstrates the classifier fits the data well (P = .17). A simpler rule-based keyword approach had a decrease in sensitivity when compared with the NLP classifier from 56.0% to 18.2%.The NLP classifier has adequate predictive validity for identifying alcohol misuse in trauma centers.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine-learning prediction of adolescent alcohol use: A cross-study, cross-cultural validation;,citation_abstract=Background and aims The experience of alcohol use among adolescents is complex, with international differences in age of purchase and individual differences in consumption and consequences. This latter underlines the importance of prediction modeling of adolescent alcohol use. The current study (a) compared the performance of seven machine-learning algorithms to predict different levels of alcohol use in mid-adolescence and (b) used a cross-cultural cross-study scheme in the training-validation-test process to display the predictive power of the best performing machine-learning algorithm. Design A comparison of seven machine-learning algorithms: logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, neural network, lasso regression, ridge regression and elastic-net. Setting Canada and Australia. Participants The Canadian sample is part of a 4-year follow-up (2012–16) of the Co-Venture cohort (n = 3826, baseline age 12.8  0.4, 49.2% girls). The Australian sample is part of a 3-year follow-up (2012–15) of the Climate Schools and Preventure (CAP) cohort (n = 2190, baseline age 13.3  0.3, 43.7% girls). Measurements The algorithms used several prediction indices, such as F1 prediction score, accuracy, precision, recall, negative predictive value and area under the curve (AUC). Findings Based on prediction indices, the elastic-net machine-learning algorithm showed the best predictive performance in both Canadian (AUC = 0.869  0.066) and Australian (AUC = 0.855  0.072) samples. Domain contribution analysis showed that the highest prediction accuracy indices yielded from models with only psychopathology (AUC = 0.816  0.044/0.790  0.071 in Canada/Australia) and only personality clusters (AUC = 0.776  0.063/0.796  0.066 in Canada/Australia). Similarly, regardless of the level of alcohol use, in both samples, externalizing psychopathologies, alcohol use at baseline and the sensation-seeking personality profile contributed to the prediction.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An Automated System for Identifying Alcohol Use Status from Clinical Text;,citation_abstract=Alcohol use is one of the main risk factors related to many diseases. However, alcohol use information is buried in the patient’s clinical records, and extracting this information from narrative text requires substantial manual labor. This work aims to develop an automated system for detecting alcohol use status from patients’ discharge summaries. A combination of machine learning and rule-based techniques has been employed in order to identify alcohol status in three stages. In the first stage, the proposed system detects alcohol-related sentences by utilizing a keyword search technique. The second stage distinguishes between the negative and positive alcohol sentences and identifies the temporal status. In this stage different machine learning classifiers have been employed in order to achieve the best performance. Finally, the document level alcohol use status is aggregated from the sentence-level for each patient’s record. The proposed system exhibits high performance in identifying alcohol use status, achieving an Fl-score up to 0.99 in identifying alcohol use related records, 0.96 in detecting negative records and 0.89 identifying temporal status.;,citation_author=Hadeel Alzoubi;,citation_author=Naeem Ramzan;,citation_author=Raid Alzubi;,citation_author=Ehsan Mesbahi;,citation_publication_date=2018-08;,citation_cover_date=2018-08;,citation_year=2018;,citation_doi=10.1109/iCCECOME.2018.8658578;,citation_conference_title=2018 International Conference on Computing, Electronics &amp;amp;amp; Communications Engineering (iCCECE);">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Inferential Statistics as Descriptive Statistics: There Is No Replication Crisis if We Don’t Expect Replication;,citation_abstract=Statistical inference often fails to replicate. One reason is that many results may be selected for drawing inference because some threshold of a statistic like the P-value was crossed, leading to biased reported effect sizes. Nonetheless, considerable non-replication is to be expected even without selective reporting, and generalizations from single studies are rarely if ever warranted. Honestly reported results must vary from replication to replication because of varying assumption violations and random variation; excessive agreement itself would suggest deeper problems, such as failure to publish results in conflict with group expectations or desires. A general perception of a “replication crisis” may thus reflect failure to recognize that statistical tests not only test hypotheses, but countless assumptions and the entire environment in which research takes place. Because of all the uncertain and unknown assumptions that underpin statistical inferences, we should treat inferential statistics as highly unstable local descriptions of relations between assumptions and data, rather than as providing generalizable inferences about hypotheses or models. And that means we should treat statistical results as being much more incomplete and uncertain than is currently the norm. Acknowledging this uncertainty could help reduce the allure of selective reporting: Since a small P-value could be large in a replication study, and a large P-value could be small, there is simply no need to selectively report studies based on statistical results. Rather than focusing our study reports on uncertain conclusions, we should thus focus on describing accurately how the study was conducted, what problems occurred, what data were obtained, what analysis methods were used and why, and what output those methods produced.;,citation_author=Valentin Amrhein;,citation_author=David Trafimow;,citation_author=Sander Greenland;,citation_publication_date=2019-03;,citation_cover_date=2019-03;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=sup1;,citation_doi=10.1080/00031305.2018.1543137;,citation_issn=0003-1305;,citation_volume=73;,citation_journal_title=The American Statistician;,citation_publisher=Taylor &amp;amp;amp; Francis;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relapse after inpatient substance use treatment: A prospective cohort study among users of illicit substances;,citation_abstract=AIMS: The main aim was to investigate the relative roles of mental distress and intrinsic motivation for relapse after inpatient substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, while adjusting for demographics and treatment variables. METHODS: The study is based on a prospective multicenter study with a baseline gross sample of 607 patients with SUD (response rate = 84%) admitted to an inpatient stay at one of five specialized SUD treatment centers in Norway. The analytical sample consisted of patients with illicit drug use (n = 374) who took part in a follow-up interview three months after discharge from inpatient treatment (n = 249) (retention rate = 67%). Data were collected using information from electronic medical records, a self-report questionnaire at treatment entry, and a follow-up interview. RESULTS: Relapse occurred among 37% of the sample by three-month follow-up. Results of multivariable analysis showed that younger age and having a psychiatric diagnosis were associated with an elevated relapse risk. Patients who received treatment at a short-term clinic (2-4 months), as opposed to a long-term clinic ($&amp;amp;amp;gt;$6 months) were also at increased risk of relapse, regardless of their length of stay. Reduced risk of relapse was predicted by having completed the inpatient treatment stay. CONCLUSION: Identifying the treatment needs of young patients and patients with co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses during and following inpatient SUD treatment may contribute to reduced post-treatment relapse rates. Further research is needed to illuminate the treatment-related factors that contribute to reduced risk of relapse after inpatient SUD treatment.;,citation_author=Helle Wessel Andersson;,citation_author=Merethe Wenaas;,citation_author=Trond Nordfjærn;,citation_publication_date=2019-03;,citation_cover_date=2019-03;,citation_year=2019;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2018.11.008;,citation_issn=1873-6327;,citation_pmid=30447514;,citation_volume=90;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Addictive Behaviors;">

So, being a conscientious member of society, we must go ahead to prevent these young minds from life-threatening addiction. In this paper, we approach a machinelearning-based way to forecast the risk of becoming addicted to drugs using machine-learning algorithms. First, we find some significant factors for addiction by talking to doctors, drug-addicted people, and read relevant articles and write-ups. Then we collect data from both addicted and nonaddicted people. After preprocessing the data set, we apply nine conspicuous machine learning algorithms, namely k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, SVM, naïve bayes, classification, and regression trees, random forest, multilayer perception, adaptive boosting, and gradient boosting machine on our processed data set and measure the performances of each of these classifiers in terms of some prominent performance metrics. Logistic regression is found outperforming all other classifiers in terms of all metrics used by attaining an accuracy approaching 97.91%.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mobile phone sensors and supervised machine learning to identify alcohol use events in young adults: Implications for just-in-time adaptive interventions;,citation_abstract=Background Real-time detection of drinking could improve timely delivery of interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related injury, but existing detection methods are burdensome or impractical. Objective To evaluate whether phone sensor data and machine learning models are useful to detect alcohol use events, and to discuss implications of these results for just-in-time mobile interventions. Methods 38 non-treatment seeking young adult heavy drinkers downloaded AWARE app (which continuously collected mobile phone sensor data), and reported alcohol consumption (number of drinks, start/end time of prior day’s drinking) for 28days. We tested various machine learning models using the 20 most informative sensor features to classify time periods as non-drinking, low-risk (1 to 3/4 drinks per occasion for women/men), and high-risk drinking ($&amp;amp;amp;gt;$4/5 drinks per occasion for women/men). Results Among 30 participants in the analyses, 207 non-drinking, 41 low-risk, and 45 high-risk drinking episodes were reported. A Random Forest model using 30-min windows with 1day of historical data performed best for detecting high-risk drinking, correctly classifying high-risk drinking windows 90.9% of the time. The most informative sensor features were related to time (i.e., day of week, time of day), movement (e.g., change in activities), device usage (e.g., screen duration), and communication (e.g., call duration, typing speed).

More specifically, the purpose was to determine, not only how frequently these symbolic expressions are used, but how they are utilized in terms of the language functions that they signal. The results of this investigation suggest that text messaging symbols are most frequently used to identify people and their relationships to other things (including other people). They also suggest that text messaging symbols are frequently used to express amusement. In addition, the results suggest that the text messaging community has developed its own language culture in which closing expressions, long-form dialog, and correct spelling and grammar are viewed as inefficient and impractical. Finally, the results suggest that text messaging symbols are often used to signal descriptions of things that are important to the message sender.;,citation_author=Robert E.

Seventy-five teens and their parents were interviewed while participating in an adolescent chemical dependency treatment program and at three and six months following treatment. Results indicate that a number of characteristics of adolescent relapse, including rates, are comparable to those of adults. In contrast to adult relapse, adolescent relapses occur most commonly in the presence of social pressure to drink.

Although rates of and time to relapse appear to be similar for treated adolescents and adults, this critical review of the literature on adolescent relapse begins with an overview of developmental differences between adolescent and adult substance users that need to be considered when studying relapse. A summary of rates of relapse in treated teens is followed by a review of results on the predictive validity of different relapse definitions. Next, characteristics of teens’ initial relapse in terms of substances involved, situational context, and factors associated with relapse are described. Because relapse is ideally understood in the context of longer-term patterns of use, the review also discusses the extent to which early episodes of use mark clinically significant change points in post-treatment course, and how knowledge of longer-term clinical course is essential to understanding the relapse process and mechanisms underlying the maintenance of behavioral change.;,citation_author=Tammy Chung;,citation_author=Stephen A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Associations Between Socioeconomic Factors and Alcohol Outcomes;,citation_abstract=Socioeconomic status (SES) is one of the many factors influencing a person’s alcohol use and related outcomes. Findings have indicated that people with higher SES may consume similar or greater amounts of alcohol compared with people with lower SES, although the latter group seems to bear a disproportionate burden of negative alcohol-related consequences. These associations are further complicated by a variety of moderating factors, such as race, ethnicity, and gender. Thus, among individuals with lower SES, members of further marginalized communities, such as racial and ethnic minorities and homeless individuals, experience greater alcohol-related consequences. Future studies are needed to more fully explore the underlying mechanisms of the relationship between SES and alcohol outcomes.

This study reports on feasibility and acceptability of ecological assessment of daily suicide risk-related outcomes (“daily diaries,” a special case of EMA) among adolescent inpatients in the critical post-discharge period. Thirty-four adolescents (76% female; ages 13–17) responded to daily electronic surveys for four weeks after discharge. Survey adherence was 69% (n = 650 days) and decreased each week. Adherence was half as likely among adolescents without attempt history (OR = 0.50, CI = 0.27–0.95). Mid- and end-point study responses indicated high acceptability of daily diaries. Most adolescents reported no change or more positive change in their thoughts/mood after daily surveys. Suicidal ideation was reported on 24.4% (n = 159) of the days. In the month post discharge, more teens reported suicidal thoughts using daily surveys (70.6%) compared to end-of-study assessment (45.2%) (Chi-square = 4.24, p = .039). Two participants (5.9%) reported an attempt. Ideation frequency and duration varied across time, suggesting utility of frequent assessments in this context.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol Use Disorder in Older Adults: Challenges in Assessment and Treatment;,citation_abstract=Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a common, under-recognized, and under-treated health concern in older adults. Its prevalence is expected to reach unprecedented levels as the U.S. population ages; consequently, it is poised to place a significant burden on the healthcare system. Given the growing body of evidence regarding the patterns of use in this age group and the serious consequences of its misuse, it is critical that nurses and other healthcare providers assess for AUD in order to identify older adults in need of treatment. Yet, differences in symptom presentation, problems in isolating the symptoms of AUD from other healthcare complaints associated with aging, as well as the denial and fear of stigma that is especially pervasive in this age group, are major barriers to its identification and subsequent treatment. Furthermore, the lack of consistent use of evidence-based, age-specific screening instruments to identify those at risk is another significant obstacle to successful treatment. Healthcare providers in primary care are especially well-positioned to perform a systematic assessment utilizing appropriate instruments to identify AUD and initiate age-specific interventions, including the use of alcohol screening and brief interventions (ASBIs). The use of ASBIs, along with other targeted interventions such as mutual help groups (MHGs), such as Alcoholics Anonymous, can be key in encouraging insight, dismantling denial, and supporting treatment success, lifelong recovery, and overall quality of life in this vulnerable group.;,citation_author=Mary C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Gender Differences in Use of Alcohol Treatment Services and Reasons for Non-Use in a National Sample;,citation_abstract=Background: The majority of adults with alcohol use disorders do not obtain help, and women are less likely to utilize alcohol services than men. We sought to quantify gender differences in alcohol service utilization, overall and by type, using national longitudinal data and to explore potential gender differences in perceived need for help and reasons for not seeking help. Methods: We analyzed data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions from White, African American, and Hispanic adults (n=2,592) who met DSM-IV criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence at Wave 1 (2000–2001). We tested gender differences in Wave 2 (2004–2005) service utilization, perceived need for help, and treatment barriers using Rao-Scott chi-square tests and assessed predictors of outcomes in multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for problem severity, co-occurring disorders, and demographics. Results: Women had much lower odds than men of utilizing any alcohol service (aOR 0.53; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.86), specialty services (aOR 0.41; 95% CI 0.19, 0.87), and 12-step groups (aOR 0.39; 95% CI 0.21, 0.71). Perceived need for help among those who had not used any services was very low (5%), with no gender difference. Further, men and women reported equivalent numbers of treatment barriers and the same rank order for the most frequently endorsed barriers. However, women were twice as likely as men to think a problem would get better by itself—the most frequent reason for not seeking help (47% vs. 24%, p$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$.001), and men were more likely than women to report unsuccessful past help-seeking and not thinking anyone could help (19% vs. 3%, p$&amp;lt;$.001; and 17% vs. 5%, p$<$.001, respectively). Conclusions: Consistent with previous studies, women were less likely to utilize alcohol services than men.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=First-line Medications for the Outpatient Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder: A Systematic Review of Perceived Barriers;,citation_abstract=Objectives:&nbsp; Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a common illness with significant health and economic consequences. Although three pharmacotherapeutic agents have been shown to decrease heavy drinking days among individuals with AUD, they are vastly underutilized in clinical practice. The objective of this review was to elucidate barriers that may prevent patients from obtaining medication for addiction treatment (MAT) for AUD in an outpatient or residential setting. Methods:&nbsp; Electronic searches of Medline and EMBASE were conducted, and reference lists were hand-searched. All study designs which discussed the use of MAT for AUD in an outpatient or residential setting were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently screened the search output to identify potentially eligible articles, the full texts of which were retrieved and assessed for inclusion. Results:&nbsp; After eliminating duplicate citations and articles that did not meet eligibility criteria, 23 articles were included in the review. Perceived barriers to obtaining pharmacotherapy for the treatment of AUD in an outpatient or residential setting were grouped into 3 themes: lack of knowledge and concerns about efficacy and complexity of prescribing; treatment philosophy and stigma; medication accessibility including formulary restrictions, geographical and socioeconomic barriers. Conclusions:&nbsp; Although evidence-based pharmacotherapeutics have been approved for the treatment of AUD, our findings suggest patients continue to experience barriers to the use of these medications. Efforts should be made to increase rates of prescribing by providers and the use of medications by patients.

Prominent addiction theories emphasize the role of motivation in the alcohol seeking process, which has largely been studied using preclinical models. In order to bridge the gap between preclinical and clinical studies, this study examined predictors of motivation for alcohol self-administration using a novel paradigm. Heavy drinkers (n = 67) completed an alcohol infusion consisting of an alcohol challenge (target breath alcohol = 60 mg%) and a progressive-ratio alcohol self-administration paradigm (maximum breath alcohol 120 mg%; ratio requirements range = 20–3 139 response). Growth curve modeling was used to predict breath alcohol trajectories during alcohol self-administration. K-means clustering was used to identify motivated (n = 41) and unmotivated (n = 26) self-administration trajectories. The data were analyzed using two approaches: a theory-driven test of a-priori predictors and a data-driven, machine learning model. In both approaches, steeper delay discounting, indicating a preference for smaller, sooner rewards, predicted motivated alcohol seeking. The data-driven approach further identified phasic alcohol craving as a predictor of motivated alcohol self-administration.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Understanding and measuring psychological stress using social media;,citation_abstract=A body of literature has demonstrated that users’ mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, can be predicted from their social media language. There is still a gap in the scientific understanding of how psychological stress is expressed on social media. Stress is one of the primary underlying causes and correlates of chronic physical illnesses and mental health conditions. In this paper, we explore the language of psychological stress with a dataset of 601 social media users, who answered the Perceived Stress Scale questionnaire and also consented to share their Facebook and Twitter data. Firstly, we find that stressed users post about exhaustion, losing control, increased self-focus and physical pain as compared to posts about breakfast, family-time, and travel by users who are not stressed. Secondly, we find that Facebook language is more predictive of stress than Twitter language. Thirdly, we demonstrate how the language based models thus developed can be adapted and be scaled to measure county-level trends. Since county-level language is easily available on Twitter using the Streaming API, we explore multiple domain adaptation algorithms to adapt user-level Facebook models to Twitter language. We find that domain-adapted and scaled social media-based measurements of stress outperform sociodemographic variables (age, gender, race, education, and income), against ground-truth survey-based stress measurements, both at the user- and the county-level in the U.S. Twitter language that scores higher in stress is also predictive of poorer health, less access to facilities and lower socioeconomic status in counties. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of using social media as a new tool for monitoring stress levels of both individuals and counties.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A smartphone application to support recovery from alcoholism: A randomized controlled trial;,citation_abstract=Importance: Patients leaving treatment for alcohol-use disorders (AUDs) are not typically offered evidence-based continuing care, although research suggests that continuing care is associated with better outcomes. A smartphone-based application could provide effective continuing care. Objective: To determine whether patients leaving residential treatment for AUDs with a smartphone application to support recovery have fewer risky drinking days than control-group patients. Design: An un-blinded randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomized to treatment as usual or treatment as usual plus a smartphone with A-CHESS, an application designed to improve continuing care for AUDs. “A-CHESS” stands for Addiction – Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System. Setting: Three residential programs operated by one treatment organization in the Midwestern US and 2 residential programs operated by one organization in the Northeastern US. Participants: 349 patients who met the criteria for DSM-IV alcohol dependence when they entered residential treatment. 179 were randomized to the control group and 170 to the treatment group. Intervention: Treatment as usual varied across programs; none offered patients coordinated continuing care after discharge. A-CHESS provides monitoring, information, communication, and support services to patients, including ways for patients and counselors to stay in contact. The intervention lasted 8 months and the follow-up period lasted 4 months. Main Outcome Measure: Risky drinking days—the number of days during which a patient’s drinking in a 2-hour period exceeded, for men, 4 standard drinks and for women, 3 standard drinks. Patients were asked to report their risky drinking days in the previous 30 days on surveys taken 4, 8, and 12 months after discharge from residential treatment. Results: For the 8 months of the intervention and 4 months of follow-up, patients in the A-CHESS group reported significantly fewer risky drinking days than patients in the control group (M = 1.39 vs. 2.75, respectively; P = .003; 95% CI [.46, 2.27]). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that a multi-featured smartphone application may have significant benefit to patients in continuing care for AUDs.

The probability of these relapses (or lapses) is determined up to three days in advance using a logistic regression procedure. The study group consisted of 33 male alcohol-dependent persons, who participated in a treatment program. Clinical ratings were performed three times a week by a trained person during a visit to the clinic. The questionnaire contained 23 different items about irritation, craving for alcohol. sleep disturbances, etc. The relapses were either self-reported or detected by a biochemical marker in a urine sample that was taken daily. The most important factor for a relapse in alcohol drinking was shown to be if the patient already had had one relapse during the treatment. Other important clinical factors were the levels of irritation and autonomic disturbances. None of the variables measuring mood shifts was significant. Family conditions during childhood were the most important background variables. The predictions turned out to have a rather high specificity, but the sensitivity was lower. Half of the relapses were not predicted by an increased probability for relapse. Self-reported relapses were predictable from preceding interviews and were also less frequent compared to those detected objectively by the biochemical markers.;,citation_author=A. M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Statistics reform: Practitioner’s perspective;,citation_abstract=It is generally accepted that one of the main causes of the replication crisis in scientific research is some of the most commonly used statistical methods, such as null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). This has prompted many scientists and statisticians to call for statistics reform. As a practitioner in the fields of hydraulics and measurement science, the author used statistical methods extensively in many environmental engineering and hydrological survey projects. The author strongly concurs in the need for statistics reform. This paper offers a practitioner’s perspective on statistics reform. In the author’s view, some statistical methods are good and should withstand statistics reform; some are bad and should be abandoned and removed from statistics textbooks and computer software packages. This paper focuses on two statistical methods derived from the t-distribution: the two-sample t-test and the t-interval method for measurement uncertainty calculation. We show why these two methods should be abandoned. We recommend using descriptive statistic analysis as an alternative to the two-sample t-test and an unbiased estimation method as an alternative to the t-interval method for measurement uncertainty calculation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relapse as a nonlinear dynamic system: Application to patients with alcohol use disorders;,citation_abstract=Understanding the relapse process is one of the most important issues in addictive behaviors research. To date, most studies have taken a linear approach toward predicting relapse based on risk factors. Nonlinear dynamical systems theory can be used to describe processes that are not adequately modeled using a linear approach. In particular, the authors propose that catastrophe theory, a subset of nonlinear dynamical systems theory, can be used to describe the relapse process in addictive behaviors. Two small prospective studies using 6-month follow-ups of patients with alcohol use disorders (inpatient, n=51; outpatient, n=43) illustrate how cusp catastrophe theory may be used to predict relapse. Results from these preliminary studies indicate that a cusp catastrophe model has more predictive utility than traditional linear models.

Currently, evidence regarding ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for depressive disorder mostly originates from Western studies. Herein, we examined the validity of smartphone-based EMA for depression in Chinese patients and explored the determinants of use. A smartphone application, iHOPE, was used to perform daily EMA of depression, anxiety, sleep and cognitive performance. Outpatients with depressive disorder were recruited to use iHOPE for 8 weeks. Clinical characteristics and smartphone use patterns were assessed at baseline. We enrolled 59 Chinese patients with depression. In 8 weeks, participants interacted with iHOPE for an average of 10.8 (SD=12.3) days; a trend of decreased frequency of use (p=0.03) was observed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Racial Disparities in Completion Rates from Publicly Funded Alcohol Treatment: Economic Resources Explain More Than Demographics and Addiction Severity;,citation_abstract=Objectives. To assess racial and ethnic differences in rates of completion from publicly funded alcohol treatment programs, and to estimate the extent to which any identified racial differences in completion rates are related to differences in patient characteristics. Data Sources. Administrative intake and discharge records from all publicly funded outpatient and residential alcohol treatment recovery programs in Los Angeles County (LAC) during 1998–2000. Study participants (N=10,591) are African American, Hispanic, and white patients discharged from these programs, ages 18 or older, who reported alcohol as their primary substance abuse problem. Study Design. Bivariate tests identified racial and ethnic differences in rates of treatment completion and patient characteristics. Logistic regression models assessed the contribution of differences in patient characteristics to differences in completion. Principal Findings. Significantly lower completion rates by African Americans (17.5 percent) relative to whites (26.7 percent) (odds ratio [OR]=0.58, 95 percent confidence interval [CI]: 0.50–0.68) are partially explained (40 percent) by differences in patient characteristics in outpatient care (adjusted OR=0.75, 95 percent CI: 0.63–0.90), mostly by indicators of economic resources (i.e., employment, homelessness, and Medi-Cal beneficiary). In residential care, only 7 percent of differences in completion (30.7 versus 46.1 percent) could be explained by the patient-level measures available (OR=0.52, 95 percent CI: 0.45–0.59; AOR=0.55, 95 percent CI: 0.47–0.65). Differences in completion rates between Hispanic and white patients were not detected. Conclusions. Large differences in rates of outpatient and residential alcohol treatment completion between African American and white patients at publicly funded programs in LAC, the nation’s second largest, publicly funded alcohol and drug treatment system, are partially because of economic differences among patients, but remain largely unexplained. These racial disparities merit additional investigation and the attention of health professionals.;,citation_author=Jerry O. Jacobson;,citation_author=Paul L. Robinson;,citation_author=Ricky N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using Smartphones to Improve Treatment Retention Among Impoverished Substance-Using Appalachian Women: A Naturalistic Study;,citation_abstract=Objectives: Longer retention in treatment is associated with positive outcomes. For women, who suffer worse drug-related problems than men, social technologies, which are more readily adopted by women, may offer promise. This naturalistic study examined whether a smartphone-based relapse-prevention system, A-CHESS (Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System), could improve retention for women with substance use disorders in an impoverished rural setting. Methods: A total of 98 women, age 18 to 40, in southeastern Kentucky and mandated to treatment, received A-CHESS with intensive outpatient treatment for 6 months. For comparison, data were obtained for a similar but non-equivalent group of 100 same-age women also mandated to treatment in the same clinics during the period. Electronic medical record data on length-of-stay and treatment service use for both groups were analyzed, with A-CHESS use data, to determine whether those using A-CHESS showed better retention than those without. Results: Women with A-CHESS averaged 780 service units compared with 343 for the comparison group. For those with discharge dates prior to the study’s end, A-CHESS patients stayed in treatment a mean of 410 vs 262 days for the comparison group. Conclusions: Given associations between retention and positive outcomes, mobile health technology such as A-CHESS may help improve outcomes among women, especially in settings where access to in-person services is difficult. The findings, based on a non-equivalent comparison, suggest the need for further exploration with rigorous experimental designs to determine whether and to what degree access to a smartphone with A-CHESS may extend and support recovery for women.;,citation_author=Darcie C Johnston;,citation_author=W David Mathews;,citation_author=Adam Maus;,citation_author=David H Gustafson;,citation_publication_date=2019-07;,citation_cover_date=2019-07;,citation_year=2019;,citation_doi=10.1177/1178221819861377;,citation_issn=1178-2218;,citation_pmid=31312084;,citation_volume=13;,citation_journal_title=Substance Abuse: Research and Treatment;">

Neither the reliability of the original Marlatt coding system nor its predictive or construct validity was supported by this group of studies. The present commentary explores a number of possible reasons for the generally negative outcomes. These findings should certainly lead to a re-evaluation of Marlatt’s relapse taxonomy and its operationalization. Nevertheless, despite the negative results, there are a number of reasons why the general Relapse Prevention concept is likely to survive in some form: it has been widely adopted and imitated clinically, key elements of the taxonomy are often focal points of treatment, and clinical research studies have repeatedly supported some elements of the taxonomy (e.g. negative emotional states, social pressure, interpersonal conflict, positive emotional states and temptations/urges). The RREP also evaluated some modifications of the original taxonomy as well as the use of more structured assessment instruments, and some of these provided more promising results. Further developments will need to take into account both research needs for greater precision, most likely through the use of more structured assessment instruments, and clinical needs for richness of detail and sensitivity to a wide variety of life circumstances.;,citation_author=Ronald M.

To predict this difference in AUD recovery status, we analyzed the initial data using multimodal, multi-features machine learning applications including EEG source-level functional brain connectivity, Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS), medications, and demographic information. Sex and ancestry age-matched stratified analyses were performed with supervised linear Support Vector Machine application and were calculated twice, once when the ancestry was defined by self-report and once defined by genetic data. Multifeatured prediction models achieved higher accuracy scores than models based on a single domain and higher scores in male models when the ancestry was based on genetic data. The AA male group model with PRS, EEG functional connectivity, marital and employment status features achieved the highest accuracy of 86.04%. Several discriminative features were identified, including collections of PRS related to neuroticism, depression, aggression, years of education, and alcohol consumption phenotypes.

Objective: This study aimed to assess the quality of the available evidence regarding the use of mental health apps and to summarize the results obtained so far. Methods: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were searched, specifically for mobile apps on mental health issues or symptoms, and rated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. Results: A total of 7 meta-analyses were carefully reviewed and rated. Although some meta-analyses looked at any mental health issue and analyzed the data together, these studies were of poorer quality and did not offer strong empirical support for the apps. Studies focusing specifically on anxiety symptoms or depressive symptoms were of moderate to high quality and generally had small to medium effect sizes. Similarly, the effects of apps on stress and quality of life tended to offer small to medium effects and were of moderate to high quality. Studies looking at stand-alone apps had smaller effect sizes but better empirical quality than studies looking at apps with guidance. The studies that included follow-ups mostly found a sustained impact of the app at an 11-week follow-up.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Trends in Substance Use Disorders Among Adults Aged 18 or Older;,citation_abstract=Background: Substance use disorders (SUDs), which include substance dependence or abuse, have a tremendous impact on individuals, families, communities, and governments. This report highlights the number of American adults with SUDs in the past year and trends in SUDs between 2002 and 2014.&nbsp;Method:&nbsp;This report uses data from the 2002 to 2014 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health to examine trends in SUDs and receipt of treatment for substance use between 2002 and 2014.&nbsp;Results:&nbsp;Approximately 20.2 million adults aged 18 or older had a past year SUD. Of these adults, 16.3 million had an alcohol use disorder and 6.2 million had an illicit drug use disorder. An estimated 2.3 million adults had both an alcohol use disorder and an illicit drug use disorder in the past year. Of the adults with a past year SUD, 4 out of 5 had an alcohol use disorder, nearly 3 out of 10 had an illicit drug use disorder, and 1 out of 9 had both an alcohol use disorder and an illicit drug use disorder. The percentage of adults with a past year SUD in 2014 was similar to the percentages in 2010 to 2013 but was lower than the percentages in 2002 to 2009. Conclusion:&nbsp;Monitoring trends in SUDs gives public health providers opportunities to assess the scope of the issue in the United States and to plan substance abuse prevention and treatment programming. Most SUDs in the United States are related to alcohol use, and the long-term trends indicate that there has been a decrease in the prevalence of past year alcohol use disorders among adults. Although illicit drug use disorders are less prevalent than alcohol use disorders among adults, the long-term trends in this report indicate that there has not been a reduction in the percentage of adults who had an illicit drug use disorder in the past year.;,citation_author=Rachel N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The relationship between text message sentiment and self-reported depression;,citation_abstract=Background Personal sensing has shown promise for detecting behavioral correlates of depression, but there is little work examining personal sensing of cognitive and affective states. Digital language, particularly through personal text messages, is one source that can measure these markers. Methods We correlated privacy-preserving sentiment analysis of text messages with self-reported depression symptom severity. We enrolled 219&nbsp;U.S. adults in a 16 week longitudinal observational study. Participants installed a personal sensing app on their phones, which administered self-report PHQ-8 assessments of their depression severity, collected phone sensor data, and computed anonymized language sentiment scores from their text messages. We also trained machine learning models for predicting end-of-study self-reported depression status using on blocks of phone sensor and text features. Results In correlation analyses, we find that degrees of depression, emotional, and personal pronoun language categories correlate most strongly with self-reported depression, validating prior literature. Our classification models which predict binary depression status achieve a leave-one-out AUC of 0.72 when only considering text features and 0.76 when combining text with other networked smartphone sensors. Limitations Participants were recruited from a panel that over-represented women, caucasians, and individuals with self-reported depression at baseline. As language use differs across demographic factors, generalizability beyond this population may be limited. The study period also coincided with the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, which may have affected smartphone sensor data quality. Conclusions Effective depression prediction through text message sentiment, especially when combined with other personal sensors, could enable comprehensive mental health monitoring and intervention.;,citation_author=Tony Liu;,citation_author=Jonah Meyerhoff;,citation_author=Johannes C.

This overview describes the replication methodology, summarizes seven RREP studies completed by the three research groups, and discusses five cross-cutting conclusions emerging from the studies. These conclusions are: (1) reliability of Marlatt’s taxonomic system was variable both within and across the three research sites; (2) Marlatt’s taxonomic system showed little predictive validity in analyses that used pretreatment relapse data to predict post-treatment relapse, but there are important unresolved issues; (3) an alternative taxonomy provided little more predictive validity than the original taxonomy even though it measured more dimensions of relapse;,citation_author=Cherry Lowman;,citation_author=John Allen;,citation_author=Robert L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A unified approach to interpreting model predictions;,citation_abstract=Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction’s accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.;,citation_author=Scott M.

Methods Participants were 185 PWID age 18–35 recruited from two sites of a large syringe service program in Chicago. After completing a baseline interview, participants used a mobile phone app to respond to momentary surveys on mood, substance use, and injection risk behavior for 15 days. Participants were assigned to receive surveys 4, 5, or 6 times per day. Results Participants were 68% male, 61% non-Hispanic white, 24% Hispanic, and 5% non-Hispanic Black. Out of 185 participants, 8% (n = 15) failed to complete any EMA assessments. Among 170 EMA responders, the mean number of days reporting was 10 (SD 4.7), the mean proportion of assessments completed was 0.43 (SD 0.27), and 76% (n = 130) completed the follow-up interview. In analyses adjusted for age and race/ethnicity, women were more responsive than men to the EMA surveys in days reporting (IRR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.13–1.56), and total number of surveys completed (IRR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.18–1.93).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relapse prevention: Maintenance strategies in the treatment of addictive behaviors, 2nd ed;,citation_abstract=In the two decades since the first edition of this book was published in 1985, much has happened in the relapse prevention (RP) field. Many of these new developments and areas of application are described in this new edition. This new edition differs from the original 1985 volume in several important ways. The first edition consisted of two main sections: Part I, which provided a general theoretical overview of the RP model and Part II, which contained four chapters describing application of RP with specific target behaviors (alcoholism, problem drinking, smoking, and weight management). The current edition contains chapters that extend the coverage of this approach to other addictive behaviors. Although abstinence is often the preferred goal for many substance use problems (e.g., quitting smoking), moderation is required for eating behavior and may be an alternative goal for other problems (e.g., moderate drinking or gambling). In the current text, RP methods are described for client goals that include both abstinence and harm reduction. The most important change for readers to note is that this new edition of the RP book is designed to be used in conjunction with the second edition of our companion volume, Assessment of Addictive Behaviors (Donovan &amp;amp;amp; Marlatt, 2005). The same authors were invited to provide both the assessment and RP chapters, so as to enhance congruence of coverage and cross-referenced materials.

Research conducted during the 1970s on determinants of relapse is briefly reviewed, beginning with a preliminary analysis of relapse patterns in alcoholics treated with aversion therapy. Theoretical foundations underlying the development of the taxonomy are then discussed with an emphasis on social-learning theory and its implications for cognitive-behavioral interventions for relapse prevention. Findings supporting the efficacy of coping-skills training for high-risk relapse situations, based on a prospective treatment outcome study for inpatient alcoholics, are also presented in support of the clinical validity of the relapse model.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Is psychology suffering from a replication crisis? What does “failure to replicate” really mean?;,citation_abstract=Psychology has recently been viewed as facing a replication crisis because efforts to replicate past study findings frequently do not show the same result. Often, the first study showed a statistically significant result but the replication does not. Questions then arise about whether the first study results were false positives, and whether the replication study correctly indicates that there is truly no effect after all. This article suggests these so-called failures to replicate may not be failures at all, but rather are the result of low statistical power in single replication studies, and the result of failure to appreciate the need for multiple replications in order to have enough power to identify true effects. We provide examples of these power problems and suggest some solutions using Bayesian statistics and meta-analysis. Although the need for multiple replication studies may frustrate those who would prefer quick answers to psychology’s alleged crisis, the large sample sizes typically needed to provide firm evidence will almost always require concerted efforts from multiple investigators. As a result, it remains to be seen how many of the recently claimed failures to replicate will be supported or instead may turn out to be artifacts of inadequate sample sizes and single study replications.

Results and discussion: This systematic review has investigated and identified barriers to treatment that vary greatly according to personal, cultural, institutional, ethnic and gender-specific factors. Three barriers proved to be prominent: Shame and stigma, lack of perception of treatment need and the paradox of both need for and fear of giving up drinking.

The review notes the continued move in relapse research from a primary reliance on retrospective assessment of factors surrounding the onset of relapse episodes to an increased focus on the use of new technologies to obtain &amp;amp;amp;quot;near real time&amp;quot; data on proximal factors in relapses. Recent advances in neurobiology have yielded important gains in our understanding of vulnerability to relapse in alcohol and other drug abusers. New statistical techniques are also available to analyze data on relapse. From a theoretical standpoint, there has been an increasing appreciation for the complicated and dynamic interplay of distal and proximal factors in the relapse process. At this point, the strongest and most detailed data on factors in the onset and course of relapse have been generated by studies of smoking relapses that have made use of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) technology. However, there is still limited &quot;near real&quot; time data on proximal factors in alcohol and other drug relapses, and no such data on factors that influence the course of these relapses, once they have begun.

This study tested whether supplementing intensive outpatient programs (IOPs) with continuing care delivered via (1) telephone, (2) smartphone or (3) their combination improves outcomes relative to (4) IOP only. Continuing care conditions were also compared. Design Randomized controlled trial of four groups with 3-, 6-, 9-, 12- and 18-month follow-ups. Setting University research center in Philadelphia, PA, USA. Participants Participants (n = 262) met DSM-V criteria for AUD, were largely male (71%) and African American (82%). Interventions and Comparator Telephone monitoring and counseling (TMC; n = 59), addiction comprehensive health enhancement support system (ACHESS; n = 68) and TMC + ACHESS (n = 70) provided for 12 months. The control condition received IOP only (TAU; n = 65). Measurement The primary outcome was percentage of days heavy drinking (PDHD) in months 1–12. Secondary outcomes were any drinking, any drug use, drinking consequences and quality of life. Findings Mean PDHD in months 1–12 was 10.29 in TAU, 5.41 in TMC, 6.80 in ACHESS and 5.99 in TMC + ACHESS. PDHD was lower in TMC [Cohen’s d = 0.35, P = 0.018, 95% confidence interval (CI) = (-1.42, -0.20)], ACHESS [d = 0.31, P = 0.031, 95% CI = (-1.27, -0.06)] and TMC + ACHESS [d = 0.36, P = 0.009, 95% CI = (-1.40, -0.20)] than in TAU. Differences between TMC + ACHESS, TMC and ACHESS were small (d $\leq$ 0.06) and non-significant. Findings were inconclusive as to whether or not the treatment conditions differed on PDHD at 18 months. A significant effect was obtained on any drinking, which was higher in months 1–12 in TAU than in TMC [odds ratio (OR) = 3.02, standard error (SE) = 0.43, 95% CI = (1.30, 6.99), P = 0.01] and TMC + ACHESS [OR = 2.43, SE = 0.39, 95% CI = (1.12, 5.27), P = 0.025). No other significant effects were obtained on other secondary outcomes during or after treatment.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Studies of factors in relapse to alcohol, drug and nicotine use: A critical review of methodologies and findings.;,citation_abstract=Objective: To critically review the methodologies used to study relapse in substance abusers and compare some of the findings these methodologies have produced. Method: Representative studies that have used retrospective, prospective, or near real time methodologies to study antecedents or consequences of relapse are presented and the strengths and weaknesses of each methodology are reviewed. Limitations in the ability of substance abusers to accurately report internal states are considered. Degree of convergence in findings across methodologies is examined. Results: Retrospective reports can provide perhaps the most detailed accounts of circumstances and experiences leading up to relapse, but are also more likely to be inaccurate due to the limitations of memory. Prospective studies are less likely to be affected by memory problems, but may not capture factors that immediately precede relapse. The near real time methodology, which uses palm-top computers to gather data, has many advantages over other methodologies, but a number of limitations as well. The two studies in which retrospective reports were directly compared to either prospective or near real time reports yielded mixed results regarding degree of agreement. Findings from several areas of research suggest that some substance abusers may have difficulty recognizing and reporting internal states. Conclusions: Despite memory problems and other limitations of self-report, all three methodologies have produced findings that implicate negative affect states, increased craving, cognitive factors, interpersonal problems, and lack of coping as factors in relapse. Future relapse studies should make use of all three methodologies to obtain data on relapse and consequences, and steps should be taken to enhance the accuracy of the self-reports that are gathered with each method.;,citation_author=J R McKay;,citation_publication_date=1999-07;,citation_cover_date=1999-07;,citation_year=1999;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.15288/jsa.1999.60.566;,citation_issn=0096-882X;,citation_volume=60;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Studies on Alcohol;,citation_publisher=Alcohol Research Documentation, Inc.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=What is a relapse? Fifty ways to leave the wagon;,citation_abstract=Binary thinking has often guided research and practice in the addiction field. For example, emphasis has been given to identifying whether an individual is ’alcoholic’ or not, and the dichotomous judgement that a client is either drinking or abstinent has been used to judge treatment effectiveness. Research on the nature of alcohol problems, however, indicates that they lie along several modestly interrelated continuous dimensions of severity, rather than occurring as a single syndrome qualitatively distinct from normality. Similarly, changes in addictive behaviors in general, and treatment outcomes in particular, are complex phenomena not readily captured by dichotomous classification. The term ’relapse’ is itself seriously problematic in various ways, and its definition elusive. It represents a somewhat arbitrary binary judgement imposed on the flow of behavior, and carries negative evaluative overtones. A potentially detrimental abstinence violation effect is implicit in the very use of the term ’relapse’, which thereby may become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Further, it implicitly pathologizes what is in fact a rather common event in the course of behavior change, and embodies an unrealistic and inaccurate conception of how successful change occurs over time. For these reasons, it may be useful in research and clinical practice to abandon the notion of ’relapse’ and focus instead on terminology that better describes the normal resolution process for addictive behaviors.;,citation_author=William R.

This study investigates the impact of SBDH, identified from both structured and unstructured data utilizing a natural language processing (NLP) system, on suicide prediction within 7, 30, 90, and 180 days of discharge. Using EHR data of 2,987,006 Veterans between October 1, 2009, and September 30, 2015, from the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA), we designed a case-control study that demonstrates that incorporating structured and NLP-extracted SBDH significantly enhances the performance of three architecturally distinct suicide predictive models - elastic-net logistic regression, random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron. For example, RF achieved notable improvements in suicide prediction within 180 days of discharge, with an increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 83.57&amp;amp;amp;amp;ndash;84.25% (95% CI&amp;amp;thinsp;=&amp;amp;thinsp;0.63%-0.98%, p-val&amp;amp;thinsp;&amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;thinsp;0.001) and the area under the precision recall curve from 57.38&amp;amp;ndash;59.87% (95% CI&amp;amp;thinsp;=&amp;amp;thinsp;3.86%-4.82%, p-val&amp;amp;thinsp;&amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;thinsp;0.001) after integrating NLP-extracted SBDH.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Implementation and workflow strategies for integrating digital therapeutics for alcohol use disorders into primary care: A qualitative study;,citation_abstract=Background: Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are prevalent and often go untreated. Patients are commonly screened for AUD in primary care, but existing treatment programs are failing to meet demand. Digital therapeutics include novel mobile app-based treatment approaches which may be cost-effective treatment options to help fill treatment gaps. The goal of this study was to identify implementation needs and workflow design considerations for integrating digital therapeutics for AUD into primary care. Methods: We conducted qualitative interviews with clinicians, care delivery leaders, and implementation staff (n = 16) in an integrated healthcare delivery system in the United States. All participants had experience implementing digital therapeutics for depression or substance use disorders in primary care. Interviews were designed to gain insights into adaptations needed to optimize existing clinical processes, workflows, and implementation strategies for use with alcohol-focused digital therapeutics. Interviews were recorded and transcribed and then analyzed using a rapid analysis process and affinity diagramming. Results: Qualitative themes were well represented across health system staff roles. Participants were enthusiastic about digital therapeutics for AUD, anticipated high patient demand for such a resource, and made suggestions for successful implementation. Key insights regarding the implementation of digital therapeutics for AUD and unhealthy alcohol use from our data include: (1) implementation strategy selection must be driven by digital therapeutic design and target population characteristics, (2) implementation strategies should seek to minimize burden on clinicians given the large numbers of patients with AUD who are likely to be interested in and eligible for digital therapeutics, and (3) digital therapeutics should be offered alongside many other treatment options to accommodate individual patients’ AUD severity and treatment goals. Participants also expressed confidence that previous implementation strategies used with other digital therapeutics such as clinician training, electronic health record supports, health coaching, and practice facilitation would be effective for the implementation of digital therapeutics for AUD. Conclusions: The implementation of digital therapeutics for AUD would benefit from careful consideration of the target population. Optimal integration requires tailoring workflows to meet anticipated patient volume and designing workflow and implementation strategies to meet the unique needs of patients with varying AUD severity.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Crowdsourcing a Word-Emotion Association Lexicon;,citation_abstract=Even though considerable attention has been given to the polarity of words (positive and negative) and the creation of large polarity lexicons, research in emotion analysis has had to rely on limited and small emotion lexicons. In this paper we show how the combined strength and wisdom of the crowds can be used to generate a large, high-quality, word-emotion and word-polarity association lexicon quickly and inexpensively. We enumerate the challenges in emotion annotation in a crowdsourcing scenario and propose solutions to address them. Most notably, in addition to questions about emotions associated with terms, we show how the inclusion of a word choice question can discourage malicious data entry, help identify instances where the annotator may not be familiar with the target term (allowing us to reject such annotations), and help obtain annotations at sense level (rather than at word level). We conducted experiments on how to formulate the emotion-annotation questions, and show that asking if a term is associated with an emotion leads to markedly higher inter-annotator agreement than that obtained by asking if a term evokes an emotion.;,citation_author=Saif M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Personal Sensing: Understanding Mental Health Using Ubiquitous Sensors and Machine Learning;,citation_abstract=Sensors in everyday devices, such as our phones, wearables, and computers, leave a stream of digital traces. Personal sensing refers to collecting and analyzing data from sensors embedded in the context of daily life with the aim of identifying human behaviors, thoughts, feelings, and traits. This article provides a critical review of personal sensing research related to mental health, focused principally on smartphones, but also including studies of wearables, social media, and computers. We provide a layered, hierarchical model for translating raw sensor data into markers of behaviors and states related to mental health. Also discussed are research methods as well as challenges, including privacy and problems of dimensionality. Although personal sensing is still in its infancy, it holds great promise as a method for conducting mental health research and as a clinical tool for monitoring at-risk populations and providing the foundation for the next generation of mobile health (or mHealth) interventions.;,citation_author=David C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol use and the COVID-19 pandemic: Historical trends in drinking, contexts, and reasons for use among U.S. adults;,citation_abstract=Objective The current study used U.S. national data to examine drinking trends prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, focusing on changes in U.S. young- and middle-adult alcohol prevalence, frequency, and drinking contexts and reasons, and whether they differed by age and college status. Methods Data from 2015 to 2020 from 16,987 young adults (ages 19–30) and 23,584 middle adults (ages 35–55) in the national Monitoring the Future study were used to model historical trends and potential 2020 shifts (data collection April 1 to November 30, 2020) in prevalence (30-day, daily, binge drinking) and frequency (30-day, binge drinking). For young adults, data on drinking contexts and negative affect reasons for drinking were examined. Moderation by age and college status was also tested. Results 2020 was associated with (1) downward deviation in 30-day (young and middle adults) and binge drinking (young adults) prevalence; (2) upward deviation in daily drinking prevalence (middle adults); (3) among drinkers, upward deviation in frequency of 30-day (young and middle adults) and binge drinking (young adults); and (4) changes in drinking contexts and reasons among drinkers. Among college students, in particular, 2020 was associated with a downward deviation from expected historical trends in drinking prevalence. Upward deviations in daily prevalence and both binge and 30-day drinking frequency were stronger at ages 25–30 (vs. 19–24) and 35–45 (vs. 50–55). Conclusions Among U.S. young and middle adults, deviations from expected historical trends in population alcohol use that occurred during the pandemic included decreases in alcohol use prevalence, increases in alcohol use frequency, and increases in the use of alcohol to relax/relieve tension and because of boredom. These shifts were likely due, in part, to drinking while alone and at home—which increased during the pandemic.;,citation_author=Megan E. Patrick;,citation_author=Yvonne M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Acceptability of digital health interventions: Embracing the complexity;,citation_abstract=Acceptability is a core concept in digital health. Available frameworks have not clearly articulated why and how researchers, practitioners and policy makers may wish to study the concept of acceptability. Here, we aim to discuss (i) the ways in which acceptability might differ from closely related concepts, including user engagement; (ii) the utility of the concept of acceptability in digital health research and practice; (iii) social and cultural norms that influence acceptability; and (iv) pragmatic means of measuring acceptability, within and beyond the research process. Our intention is not to offer solutions to these open questions but to initiate a debate within the digital health community. We conducted a narrative review of theoretical and empirical examples from the literature. First, we argue that acceptability may usefully be considered an emergent property of a complex, adaptive system of interacting components (e.g., affective attitude, beliefs), which in turn influences (and is influenced by) user engagement. Second, acceptability is important due to its ability to predict and explain key outcomes of interest, including user engagement and intervention effectiveness. Third, precisely what people find acceptable is deeply contextualized and interlinked with prevailing social and cultural norms. Understanding and designing for such norms (e.g., through drawing on principles of user centered design) is therefore key. Finally, there is a lack of standard acceptability measures and thresholds. Star ratings coupled with free-text responses may provide a pragmatic means of capturing acceptability. Acceptability is a multifaceted concept, which may usefully be studied with a complexity science lens.;,citation_author=Olga Perski;,citation_author=Camille E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Digital Health Interventions for Delivery of Mental Health Care: Systematic and Comprehensive Meta-Review;,citation_abstract=Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted mental health care delivery to digital platforms, videoconferencing, and other mobile communications. However, existing reviews of digital health interventions are narrow in scope and focus on a limited number of&nbsp;mental health conditions. Objective: To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive systematic meta-review of the literature to assess the state of digital health interventions for the treatment of mental health conditions. Methods: We searched MEDLINE for secondary literature published between 2010 and 2021 on the use, efficacy, and appropriateness of digital health interventions for the delivery of mental health care. Results: Of the 3022 records identified, 466 proceeded to full-text review and 304 met the criteria for inclusion in this study. A majority (52%) of research involved the treatment of substance use disorders, 29% focused on mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders, and &amp;amp;amp;gt;5% for each remaining mental health conditions. Synchronous and asynchronous communication, computerized therapy, and cognitive training appear to be effective but require further examination in understudied mental health conditions. Similarly, virtual reality, mobile apps, social media platforms, and web-based forums are novel technologies that have the potential to improve mental health but require higher quality evidence. Conclusions: Digital health interventions offer promise in the treatment of mental health conditions. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital health interventions provide a safer alternative to face-to-face treatment. However, further research on the applications of digital interventions in understudied mental health conditions is needed. Additionally, evidence is needed on the effectiveness and appropriateness of digital health tools for patients who are marginalized and may lack access to digital health interventions.;,citation_author=Tristan J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in psychiatric patients and student controls: A real-world feasibility study;,citation_abstract=Background Smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a promising methodology for mental health research. The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of smartphone-based active and passive EMA in psychiatric outpatients and student controls. Methods Two smartphone applications —MEmind and eB2— were developed for behavioral active and passive monitoring. The applications were tested in psychiatric patients with a history of suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors (STB), psychiatric patients without a history of STB, and student controls. Main outcome was feasibility, measured as response to recruitment, retention, and EMA compliance. Secondary outcomes were patterns of smartphone usage. Results Response rate was 87.3% in patients with a history of STB, 85.1% in patients without a history of STB, and 75.0% in student controls. 457 participants installed the MEmind app (120 patients with a history of STB and 337 controls) and 1,708 installed the eB2 app (139 patients with a history of STB, 1,224 patients with no history of STB and 346 controls). For the MEmind app, participants were followed-up for a median of 49.5, resulting in 22,622 person-days. For the eB2 application, participants were followed-up for a median of 48.9 days, resulting in 83,521 person-days. EMA compliance rate was 65.00% in suicidal patients and 75.21% in student controls. At the end of the follow-up, over 60% of participants remained in the study. Limitations Cases and controls were not matched by age and sex. Cases were patients who were receiving adequate psychopharmacological treatment and attending their appointments, which may result in an overstatement of clinical compliance. Conclusions Smartphone-based active and passive monitoring are feasible methods in psychiatric patients in real-world settings. The development of applications with friendly interfaces and directly useful features can help increase engagement without using incentives. The MEmind and eB2 applications are promising clinical tools that could contribute to the management of mental disorders.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using machine learning to predict heavy drinking during outpatient alcohol treatment;,citation_abstract=Background Accurate clinical prediction supports the effective treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and other psychiatric disorders. Traditional statistical techniques have identified patient characteristics associated with treatment outcomes. However, less work has focused on systematically leveraging these associations to create optimal predictive models. The current study demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict clinical outcomes in people completing outpatient AUD treatment. Method We used data from the COMBINE multisite clinical trial (n = 1383) to develop and test predictive models. We identified three priority prediction targets, including (1) heavy drinking during the first month of treatment, (2) heavy drinking during the last month of treatment, and (3) heavy drinking between weekly/bi-weekly sessions. Models were generated using the random forest algorithm. We used “leave sites out” partitioning to externally validate the models in trial sites that were not included in the model training. Stratified model development was used to test for sex differences in the relative importance of predictive features. Results Models predicting heavy alcohol use during the first and last months of treatment showed internal cross-validation area under the curve (AUC) scores ranging from 0.67 to 0.74. AUC was comparable in the external validation using data from held-out sites (AUC range = 0.69 to 0.72). The model predicting between-session heavy drinking showed strong classification accuracy in internal cross-validation (AUC = 0.89) and external test samples (AUC range = 0.80 to 0.87). Stratified analyses showed substantial sex differences in optimal feature sets. Conclusion Machine learning techniques can predict alcohol treatment outcomes using routinely collected clinical data. This technique has the potential to greatly improve clinical prediction accuracy without requiring expensive or invasive assessment methods.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=2010 National and State Costs of Excessive Alcohol Consumption;,citation_abstract=INTRODUCTION: Excessive alcohol use cost the U.S. $223.5 billion in 2006. Given economic shifts in the U.S. since 2006, more-current estimates are needed to help inform the planning of prevention strategies. METHODS: From March 2012 to March 2014, the 26 cost components used to assess the cost of excessive drinking in 2006 were projected to 2010 based on incidence (e.g., change in number of alcohol-attributable deaths) and price (e.g., inflation rate in cost of medical care). The total cost, cost to government, and costs for binge drinking, underage drinking, and drinking while pregnant were estimated for the U.S. for 2010 and allocated to states. RESULTS: Excessive drinking cost the U.S. $249.0 billion in 2010, or about $2.05 per drink. Government paid for $100.7 billion (40.4%) of these costs. Binge drinking accounted for $191.1 billion (76.7%) of costs; underage drinking $24.3 billion (9.7%) of costs; and drinking while pregnant $5.5 billion (2.2%) of costs. The median cost per state was $3.5 billion. Binge drinking was responsible for $&amp;amp;amp;gt;$70% of these costs in all states, and $&amp;gt;$40% of the binge drinking-related costs were paid by government. CONCLUSIONS: Excessive drinking cost the nation almost $250 billion in 2010. Two of every $5 of the total cost was paid by government, and three quarters of the costs were due to binge drinking. Several evidence-based strategies can help reduce excessive drinking and related costs, including increasing alcohol excise taxes, limiting alcohol outlet density, and commercial host liability.;,citation_author=Jeffrey J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Perceived Barriers to Treatment for Alcohol Problems: A Latent Class Analysis;,citation_abstract=Objective: Low rates of alcohol treatment seeking have been shown to be associated with perceived barriers to treatment, but heterogeneity in patterns of perceived barriers has not been explored. The study analyzed data from a population-based sample of adults with alcohol abuse and dependence in order to describe latent classes of individuals who reported one or more of 15 perceived barriers to seeking alcohol treatment and to identify characteristics associated with class membership. Methods: Data were from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (2001–2002). Analyses were restricted to treatment-naive adults with alcohol abuse or dependence who reported a perceived treatment need (N=1,053). Latent class analysis was performed to identify subgroups with respect to barriers to treatment. Latent class regression identified variables associated with each subgroup. Results: Two subgroups emerged: the low-barriers class (87%), characterized primarily by attitudinal barriers, and the high-barriers class (13%), characterized by significant attitudinal, financial, stigma, and readiness-for-change barriers. In both classes, the most frequently endorsed barrier was the attitudinal belief that “I should be strong enough” to handle the problem without treatment. Univariate analyses showed strong associations between membership in the high-barriers class and comorbid psychiatric disorders, alcohol dependence (compared with abuse), and a family history of alcohol problems. Multivariate analyses found significant associations with a lifetime anxiety disorder and with education level. Conclusions: Attitudinal barriers were most prevalent. Findings revealed a notable subgroup with multiple barriers, including financial and stigma-related barriers.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pathways in the relapse–treatment–recovery cycle over 3 years;,citation_abstract=For many individuals, substance use leads to a chronic cycle of relapse, treatment reentry, and recovery, often lasting for decades. This study replicates earlier work, documents the transition patterns within the cycle during a 3-year period, and identifies variables that predict these transitions. Data are from 1,326 adults recruited from sequential admissions to 12 substance abuse treatment facilities in Chicago, IL, between 1996 and 1998. Participants were predominantly female (60%) and African American (88%) adults. Participants were interviewed at intake, and at 6, 24, and 36 months post-intake follow-up rates ranged from 94% to 98% per wave. At each observation, participants’ current status in the cycle was classified as (1) in the community using, (2) incarcerated, (3) in treatment, or (4) in the community not using. The transitional probabilities and correlates of pathways between these states were estimated. Over 83% of the participants transitioned from one point in the cycle to another during the 3 years (including 36% two times, 14% three times). For the people in the community, about half remained in the same status (either using or abstinent) and just under half transitioned. The majority of people whose beginning status was incarceration or in-treatment also transitioned by the end of the observation period. While there was some overlap, predictors typically varied by pathway and direction (e.g., using to not using vs. not using to using). These results help demonstrate the need to adopt a chronic vs. acute care model for substance use. While exploratory and observational, several of the predictors are time-dependent and identify promising targets for interventions designed to shorten the cycle and increase the long-term effectiveness of treatment.;,citation_author=Christy K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Modeling Complexity of EMA Data: Time-Varying Lagged Effects of Negative Affect on Smoking Urges for Subgroups of Nicotine Addiction;,citation_abstract=Introduction: Ecological momentary assessments (EMA) are increasingly used in studies of smoking behavior. Through EMA, examination of lagged relationships is particularly useful for establishing a temporal order of events and for identifying types and timing of risk factors. The time-varying effect model (TVEM) handles EMA data challenges and addresses unique questions about the time-varying effects. Methods: Generalized TVEM was applied to EMA data from a smoking cessation study to investigate a “time-varying lagged” effect of negative affect on high smoking urges. Participants included 224 smokers with a smoking history of 23.1 years (SD = 9.8) smoking 27.3 cigarettes per day (SD = 10.7), which provided 11,394 EMAs following a quit attempt and prior to a smoking lapse. Results: The effect of negative affect was found to vary as a function of a time lag, with stronger immediate effects: estimated odds ratio (OR) of 2.7 for the lower nicotine-dependence group (time to first morning cigarette $&amp;amp;amp;gt;$ 5min, 57.6%) and OR of 2.4 for the higher nicotine-dependence group ($\leq$ 5min).

The expectation is that most statistically significant findings can be replicated in new data and in new laboratories, but in practice many findings have replicated less often than expected, leading to claims of a replication crisis. We review recent methodological literature on questionable research practices, meta-analysis, and power analysis to explain the apparently high rates of failure to replicate. Psychologists can improve research practices to advance knowledge in ways that improve replicability. We recommend that researchers adopt open science conventions of preregi-stration and full disclosure and that replication efforts be based on multiple studies rather than on a single replication attempt.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identifying Gender from SMS Text Messages;,citation_abstract=Short message service (SMS) has become a very popular medium for communication due to its convenience and low cost. SMS text messaging makes it easy to provide a false name, age, gender, and location in order to hide one’s true identity. Consequently it has become important to establish new cyber forensics methods, such as detecting SMS message authors, as a post-hoc analysis technique deemed useful in criminal persecution cases. In this paper, we propose a new combined method for authorship classification of gender of SMS text messages, which combines machine learning algorithms with text processing features to increase the prediction accuracy of the author gender classification.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predictive validity of Marlatt’s relapse taxonomy versus a more general relapse code;,citation_abstract=Marlatt’s system for classifying relapses involves integrating information about the context of a relapse into a judgment about the most critical aspects of the situation. Constraints in this taxonomy, however, may limit its validity. On a sample of 300 subjects drawn from six treatment facilities, we compared the predictive validity of Marlatt’s taxonomy with that of a coding scheme with fewer constraints. Marlatt’s taxonomy does not significantly predict drinking outcome, nor does it predict time to relapse. There is weak evidence, however, that under some circumstances Marlatt’s taxonomy can predict the type of relapse subsequently observed. The alternative coding system also does not seem useful for predicting drinking outcome, although a possible association was found between internal attribution and time to return to heavy drinking. The alternative system does seem to be able to detect repetitive aspects of subsequent relapse situations; lack of social interactions, family setting, anxiety and depression were most likely to repeat. It may be useful to consider these relapse attributes in treatment planning. The minimal predictive validity for both the Marlatt and the alternative relapse code may be due to weaknesses in the relatively unstructured interview used to gather the data, or to failure to assess the most critical dimensions relating to subsequent relapse.;,citation_author=Robert L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine learning vs addiction therapists: A pilot study predicting alcohol dependence treatment outcome from patient data in behavior therapy with adjunctive medication;,citation_abstract=Background and objectives Clinical staff providing addiction treatment predict patient outcome poorly. Prognoses based on linear statistics are rarely replicated. Addiction is a complex non-linear behavior. Incorporating non-linear models, Machine Learning (ML) has successfully predicted treatment outcome when applied in other areas of medicine. Using identical assessment data across the two groups, this study compares the accuracy of ML models versus clinical staff to predict alcohol dependence treatment outcome in behavior therapy using patient data only. Methods Machine learning models (n = 28) were constructed (“trained”) using demographic and psychometric assessment data from 780 previously treated patients who had undertaken a 12 week, abstinence-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy program for alcohol dependence. Independent predictions applying assessment data for an additional 50 consecutive patients were obtained from 10 experienced addiction therapists and the 28 trained ML models. The predictive accuracy of the ML models and the addiction therapists was then compared with further investigation of the 10 best models selected by cross-validated accuracy on the training-set. Variables selected as important for prediction by staff and the most accurate ML model were examined. Results The most accurate ML model (Fuzzy Unordered Rule Induction Algorithm, 74%) was significantly more accurate than the four least accurate clinical staff (51%–40%). However, the robustness of this finding may be limited by the moderate area under the receiver operator curve (AUC = 0.49). There was no significant difference in mean aggregate predictive accuracy between 10 clinical staff (56.1%) and the 28 best models (58.57%). Addiction therapists favoured demographic and consumption variables compared with the ML model using more questionnaire subscales. Conclusions The majority of staff and ML models were not more accurate than suggested by chance. However, the best performing prediction models may provide useful adjunctive information to standard clinically available prognostic data to more effectively target treatment approaches in clinical settings.;,citation_author=Martyn Symons;,citation_author=Gerald F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predicting alcohol dependence treatment outcomes: A prospective comparative study of clinical psychologists versus “trained” machine learning models;,citation_abstract=Background and aims Clinical staff are typically poor at predicting alcohol dependence treatment outcomes. Machine learning (ML) offers the potential to model complex clinical data more effectively. This study tested the predictive accuracy of ML algorithms demonstrated to be effective in predicting alcohol dependence outcomes, compared with clinical judgement and traditional linear regression. Design Prospective study. ML models were trained on 1016 previously treated patients (training-set) who attended a hospital-based alcohol and drug clinic. ML models (n = 27), clinical psychologists (n = 10) and a “traditional” logistic regression model (n = 1) predicted treatment outcome during the initial treatment session of an alcohol dependence programme. Setting A 12-week cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-based abstinence programme for alcohol dependence in a hospital-based alcohol and drug clinic in Australia. Participants Prospective predictions were made for 220 new patients (test-set; 70.91% male, mean age = 35.78 years, standard deviation = 9.19). Sixty-nine (31.36%) patients successfully completed treatment. Measurements Treatment success was the primary outcome variable. The cross-validated training-set accuracy of ML models was used to determine optimal parameters for selecting models for prospective prediction. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operator curve (AUC), Brier score and calibration curves were calculated and compared across predictions. Findings The mean aggregate accuracy of the ML models (63.06%) was higher than the mean accuracy of psychologist predictions (56.36%). The most accurate ML model achieved 70% accuracy, as did logistic regression. Both were more accurate than psychologists (P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.05) and had superior calibration. The high specificity for the selected ML (79%) and logistic regression (90%) meant they were significantly (P $&amp;lt;$ 0.001) more effective than psychologists (50%) at correctly identifying patients whose treatment was unsuccessful. For ML and logistic regression, high specificity came at the expense of sensitivity (26 and 31%, respectively), resulting in poor prediction of successful patients. Conclusions Machine learning models and logistic regression appear to be more accurate than psychologists at predicting treatment outcomes in an abstinence programme for alcohol dependence, but sensitivity is low.;,citation_author=Martyn Symons;,citation_author=Gerald F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Validation of an alcohol misuse classifier in hospitalized patients;,citation_abstract=Background Current modes of identifying alcohol misuse in hospitalized patients rely on self-report questionnaires and diagnostic codes that have limitations, including low sensitivity. Information in the clinical notes of the electronic health record (EHR) may further augment the identification of alcohol misuse. Natural language processing (NLP) with supervised machine learning has been successful at analyzing clinical notes and identifying cases of alcohol misuse in trauma patients. METHODS: An alcohol misuse NLP classifier, previously developed on trauma patients who completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, was validated in a cohort of 1000 hospitalized patients at a large, tertiary health system between January 1, 2007 and September 1, 2017. The clinical notes were processed using the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) guidelines for alcohol misuse were used during annotation of the medical records in our validation dataset. RESULTS: The alcohol misuse classifier had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 (95% CI 0.90–0.93) in the cohort of hospitalized patients. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.88 (95% CI 0.85–0.90), 0.78 (95% CI 0.74–0.82), 0.85 (95% CI 0.82–0.87), and 0.82 (95% CI 0.78–0.86), respectively. The Hosmer–Lemeshow Test (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.13) demonstrates good model fit. Additionally, there was a dose-dependent response in alcohol consumption behaviors across increasing strata of predicted probabilities for alcohol misuse. CONCLUSION: The alcohol misuse NLP classifier had good discrimination and test characteristics in hospitalized patients. An approach using the clinical notes with NLP and supervised machine learning may better identify alcohol misuse cases than conventional methods solely relying on billing diagnostic codes.;,citation_author=Daniel To;,citation_author=Brihat Sharma;,citation_author=Niranjan Karnik;,citation_author=Cara Joyce;,citation_author=Dmitriy Dligach;,citation_author=Majid Afshar;,citation_publication_date=2020-05;,citation_cover_date=2020-05;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.alcohol.2019.09.008;,citation_issn=0741-8329;,citation_volume=84;,citation_journal_title=Alcohol;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Experienced Burden of and Adherence to Smartphone-Based Ecological Momentary Assessment in Persons with Affective Disorders;,citation_abstract=(1) Background: The use of smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) questionnaires in affective disorder research has rapidly increased. Though, a thorough understanding of experienced burden of and adherence to EMA is crucial in determining the usefulness of EMA. (2) Methods: Persons with current affective disorders (n = 100), remitted persons (n = 190), and healthy controls (n = 94) participated in a smartphone-based EMA two-week monitoring period. Our primary outcomes were (momentary) perceived burden of and adherence to EMA. (3) Results: In the whole sample, lower positive and higher negative affect were associated with slightly higher levels of perceived momentary burden (B = -0.23 [95%CI = -0.27–0.19], B = 0.30 [95%CI = 0.24–0.37], respectively). The persons with current affective disorders reported slightly higher levels of experienced momentary burden (Mdn = 1.98 [IQR = 1.28–2.57]), than the remitted persons (Mdn = 1.64 [IQR = 1.11–2.24]) and healthy controls (Mdn = 1.28 [IQR = 1.04–1.92]). Nevertheless, the persons with current affective disorders still showed very high adherence rates (Mdn = 94.3% [IQR = 87.9–97.1]), at rates on a par with the remitted persons (Mdn = 94.3% [IQR = 90.0–97.1]) and healthy controls (Mdn = 94.3% [IQR = 90.0–98.6]). (4) Discussion: Frequent momentary questionnaires of mental well-being are slightly more burdensome to the persons with current affective disorders, but this does not seem to have a negative impact on adherence. Their high rate of adherence to EMA—which was similar to that in remitted persons and healthy controls —suggests that it is feasible to apply (short-duration) EMA.;,citation_author=Claire R.

Multivariate models were fit for 3 barriers to seeking help (structural, attitudinal, and readiness for change) for either alcohol or drug problems, controlling for socio-demographic characteristics and problem severity. Predicted probabilities were generated to evaluate gender differences by racial/ethnic subgroups. Over three quarters of the samples endorsed attitudinal barriers related to either alcohol or drug use. Generally, women were less likely to endorse attitudinal barriers for alcohol problems. African Americans and Latina/os were less likely than Whites to endorse attitudinal barriers for alcohol problems, Latina/os were less likely than Whites to endorse readiness for change barriers for alcohol and drug problems, however, African Americans were more likely to endorse structural barriers for alcohol problems. Comparisons within racial/ethnic subgroups by gender revealed more complex findings, although across all racial/ethnic groups women endorsed attitudinal barriers for alcohol problems more than men.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Automated-detection of risky alcohol use prior to surgery using natural language processing;,citation_abstract=Background Preoperative risky alcohol use is one of the most common surgical risk factors. Accurate and early identification of risky alcohol use could enhance surgical safety. Artificial Intelligence-based approaches, such as natural language processing (NLP), provide an innovative method to identify alcohol-related risks from patients’ electronic health records (EHR) before surgery. Methods Clinical notes (n = 53,629) from pre-operative patients in a tertiary care facility were analyzed for evidence of risky alcohol use and alcohol use disorder. One hundred of these records were reviewed by experts and labeled for comparison. A rule-based NLP model was built, and we assessed the clinical notes for the entire population. Additionally, we assessed each record for the presence or absence of alcohol-related International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes as an additional comparator. Results NLP correctly identified 87% of the human-labeled patients classified with risky alcohol use. In contrast, diagnosis codes alone correctly identified only 29% of these patients. In terms of specificity, NLP correctly identified 84% of the non-risky cohort, while diagnosis codes correctly identified 90% of this cohort. In the analysis of the full dataset, the NLP-based approach identified three times more patients with risky alcohol use than ICD codes. Conclusions NLP, an artificial intelligence-based approach, efficiently and accurately identifies alcohol-related risk in patients’ EHRs. This approach could supplement other alcohol screening tools to identify patients in need of intervention, treatment, and/or postoperative withdrawal prophylaxis. Alcohol-related ICD diagnosis had limited utility relative to NLP, which extracts richer information within clinical notes to classify patients.;,citation_author=V. G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol Consumption, Dependence, and Treatment Barriers: Perceptions Among Nontreatment Seekers with Alcohol Dependence;,citation_abstract=Background: Alcohol use disorders are highly prevalent worldwide. However, only a minority with alcohol dependence seek and undergo treatment. From a public health perspective, it is important to understand why people do not seek treatment. Objectives: This study aims to describe how people with alcohol dependence perceive and discuss treatment for alcohol use disorders and their reasons for seeking and not seeking treatment. Methods: 32 alcohol dependent adults from the general population participated in focus groups and individual interviews in Stockholm during 2011–2012. Data were analyzed with thematic content analysis. Results: Suffering from alcohol dependence, as well as realizing the need for, and entering treatment, were associated with shame and stigma, and were strong barriers to treatment. Other barriers included the desire to deal with alcohol problems on one’s own and the view that seeking treatment required total abstinence. Negative health-effects were mainly a nonissue. The participants’ knowledge about treatment options was limited to lifelong abstinence, medication with Disulfiram and residential treatment. These were seen as unappealing and contrasted sharply with preferred treatment. Conclusions/Importance: Public health literacy regarding alcohol use, dependence, and treatment ought to be improved in order to lower barriers to treatment. Treatment services need to better match the needs and wishes of potential service users, as well as taking stigmatization into account. In order to develop suitable treatments, and to reach the majority who do not seek treatment, the clinical understanding of alcohol dependence needs to be expanded to include mild to moderate dependence.;,citation_author=Sara Wallhed Finn;,citation_author=Ann-Sofie Bakshi;,citation_author=Sven Andréasson;,citation_publication_date=2014-05;,citation_cover_date=2014-05;,citation_year=2014;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.3109/10826084.2014.891616;,citation_issn=1082-6084;,citation_pmid=24601784;,citation_volume=49;,citation_journal_title=Substance Use &amp;amp;amp; Misuse;,citation_publisher=Taylor &amp;amp; Francis;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Modeling the complexity of post-treatment drinking: It’s a rocky road to relapse;,citation_abstract=The most widely cited road block to successful treatment outcomes for psychological and substance use disorders has been described as the return to the previous behavior, or “relapse.” The operational definition of “relapse” varies from study to study and between clinicians, but in general the term is used to indicate the return to previous levels of symptomatic behavior. One explanation for the variation in the operationalization of relapse is the wide variety of behaviors for which the term is applied, including (but not limited to): depression, substance abuse, schizophrenia, mania, sexual offending, risky sexual behavior, dieting, and the anxiety disorders. A second explanation for the multitude of definitions for relapse is the inherent complexity in the process of behavior change. In this paper we present the most recent treatment outcome research evaluating relapse rates, with a special focus on the substance use disorders. Following this review of the literature we present an argument for the operationalization of relapse as a dynamic process, which can be empirically characterized using dynamical systems theory. We support this argument by presenting results from the analysis of alcohol treatment outcomes using catastrophe modeling techniques. These results demonstrate the utility of catastrophe theory in modeling the alcohol relapse process. The implications of these analyses for the treatment of alcohol use disorders, as well as a discussion of future research incorporating nonlinear dynamical systems theory is provided.;,citation_author=Katie Witkiewitz;,citation_author=G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine learning models for temporally precise lapse prediction in alcohol use disorder;,citation_abstract=We developed three machine learning models that predict hour-by-hour probabilities of a future lapse back to alcohol use with increasing temporal precision (i.e., lapses in the next week, next day, and next hour). Model features were based on raw scores and longitudinal change in theoretically implicated risk factors collected through ecological momentary assessment. Participants (N = 151, 51% male, Mage = 41, 87% White, 97% non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1–8 weeks of abstinence) from alcohol use disorder provided 4  daily ecological momentary assessment for up to 3 months. We used grouped, nested cross-validation to select the best models and evaluate the performance of those best models. Models yielded median areas under the receiver operating curves of 0.89, 0.90, and 0.93 in the 30 held-out test sets for week-, day-, and hour-level models, respectively. Some feature categories consistently emerged as being globally important to lapse prediction across our week-, day-, and hour-level models (i.e., past use, future self-efficacy). However, most of the more punctate, time-varying constructs (e.g., craving, past stressful events, arousal) appear to have a greater impact within the next-hour prediction model. This research represents an important step toward the development of a smart (machine learning guided) sensing system that can both identify periods of peak lapse risk and recommend specific supports to address factors contributing to this risk.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Differences in Perceptions of and Practices Regarding Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorders Among VA Primary Care Providers in Urban and Rural Clinics;,citation_abstract=Background Effective behavioral and pharmacological treatments are available and recommended for patients with alcohol use disorders (AUD) but rarely received. Barriers to receipt and provision of evidence-based AUD treatments delivered by specialists may be greatest in rural areas. Methods A targeted subanalysis of qualitative interview data collected from primary care providers at 5 Veterans Affairs clinics was conducted to identify differences in provider perceptions and practices regarding AUD treatment across urban and rural clinics. Key contacts were used to recruit 24 providers from 3 “urban” clinics at medical centers and 2 “rural” community-based outpatient clinics. Providers completed 30-minute semistructured interviews, which were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results Thirteen urban and 11 rural providers participated. Urban and rural providers differed regarding referral practices and in perceptions of availability and utility of specialty addictions treatment. Urban providers described referral to specialty treatment as standard practice, while rural providers reported substantial barriers to specialty care access and infrequent specialty care referral. Urban providers viewed specialty addictions treatment as accessible and comprehensive, and perceived addictions providers as “experts” and collaborators, whereas rural providers perceived inadequate support from the health care system for AUD treatment. Urban providers desired greater integration with specialty addictions care while rural providers wanted access to local addictions treatment resources. Conclusions Providers in rural settings view referral to specialty addictions treatment as impractical and resources inadequate to treat AUD. Additional work is needed to understand the unique needs of rural clinics and decrease barriers to AUD treatment.;,citation_author=Jessica P. Young;,citation_author=Carol E.

        <p>AUD remains a prevalent, lasting and costly problem in the United States, yet few receive treatment due to barriers. Smart Digital Therapeutics (DTx) are emerging as a promising tool to address these barriers. They can potentially provide continuous risk monitoring and individualized support through personal sensing and algorithms. This study leverages SMS messages both three days and one week preceding a lapse episode to predict next-day alcohol lapse. We recruited 138 participants (65 males; 121 Whites non-Hispanic) in early recovery with a goal of abstinence. Self-reported alcohol use and text messages were obtained during a 3-month period. We enginnered features from LIWC and trained models with XGBoost. We used grouped, nested cross-validation to select the best model configuration. The median auROC was .53 (95% CI [.52, .54]) for the best model across the 300 folds in the inner loop. Our model performed consistently worse for people from different underprivileged groups. We further calculated SHAP values and discovered that social processes, social behaviors and second person pronoun emerge as the most important features. Our study suggests that the LIWC model fails to capture sufficient signal from SMS messages to be clinically useful. Our next step is to use other natural language processing methods to do feature engineering and compare the results with this baseline LIWC model. Future studies should also consider other data sources to improve model performance.</p>

<p>Despite the high prevalence of AUD, limited number of individuals receive alcohol treatments.

<section id="dtx-and-smart-dtx" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dtx-and-smart-dtx">DTx and smart DTx</h2>
<p>DTx is an effective and accessible supplemental tool that may partially address extant challenges AUD patients face. DTx are evidence-based health software that deliver assessments, interventions, and other supports to patients to prevent, or manage a disease or disorder. They can be utilized to provide continuing care for AUD patients after treatment. Available evidence suggests they are generally effective for mental health conditions including AUD and demonstrate clear clinical advantages <span class="citation" data-cites="philippeDigitalHealthInterventions2022 lecomteMobileAppsMental2020 gustafsonSmartphoneApplicationSupport2014b">(<a href="#ref-gustafsonSmartphoneApplicationSupport2014b" role="doc-biblioref">Gustafson et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-lecomteMobileAppsMental2020" role="doc-biblioref">Lecomte et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-philippeDigitalHealthInterventions2022" role="doc-biblioref">Philippe et al., 2022</a>)</span>. Further, DTx may provide better access for hard-to-reach populations, including those from socially marginalized group who encounter increased barriers to access continuing support. They can benefit patients from rural areas with low provider availability as they are accessible remotely via mobile phones <span class="citation" data-cites="bucciTheyAreNot2019 jacobsonUsingDigitalTherapeutics2023">(<a href="#ref-bucciTheyAreNot2019" role="doc-biblioref">Bucci et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-jacobsonUsingDigitalTherapeutics2023" role="doc-biblioref">N. Jacobson et al., 2023</a>)</span>. DTx also have potentials to relieve barriers to seek professional help resulting from stigma concerns as they can facilitate anonymity and shorten the need for in-person interactions. They are of lower costs compared to in person care and have the capacity to be scalable.</p>
<p>The concept of “smart” DTx is emerging in recent years allowing us to expand the benefits of DTx. Smart DTx comprises two key components. First, they rely on personal sensing methods to collect data. Exemplary measures include EMA, which actively prompts users to complete surveys and can encompass desired questions on moods, social relationships, stressful events, etc. Other relatively lower-burden sensing approaches include the measurement of geolocation, phone call logs and text messages collection. Those measures continuously and passively gather information. They can thus provide longitudinal data that can be temporally precise. Combined with self-reports that acquire contextual information (e.g., levels of support users can obtain from their frequently contacted people), they constitute rich data source for smart DTx.</p>
<p>Second, smart DTx incorporates the rich dataset extracted from personal sensing to build machine learning algorithms. The goal of such models is to identify <em>who</em> are at heightened risk for alcohol lapses, <em>when</em> they will lapse, and <em>why</em> they are at increased risk. Through the embedded algorithms, smart DTx can achieve two tasks: 1) continuous AUD relapse risk-monitoring; and 2) individualized clinical support when needed.</p>
<p>To enhance the effectiveness of smart DTx, those predictive modeling should be accurate and temporally precise. In other words, they should be capable of detecting increased lapse risks in a timely manner. These predictions allow windows for subsequent support to prevent lapses targeting a specific person. Notably, these functions are very important given the dynamic nature of alcohol relapse. Some relapse factors (e.g., drinking partner, drinking behavior) are situated and can be fluctuating over time. They usually occurs before an episode of alcohol use <span class="citation" data-cites="chihPredictiveModelingAddiction2014a">(<a href="#ref-chihPredictiveModelingAddiction2014a" role="doc-biblioref">Chih et al., 2014</a>)</span>. They can be elusive to therapists’ attention due to infrequent visits, highlighting importance of sustained monitoring to prevent lapses. AUD is a chronic, dynamic and temporally varying disease where patients face constant challenges of relapsing after abstinence <span class="citation" data-cites="scottPathwaysRelapseTreatment2005 anderssonRelapseInpatientSubstance2019 witkiewitzModelingComplexityPosttreatment2007a">(<a href="#ref-anderssonRelapseInpatientSubstance2019" role="doc-biblioref">Andersson et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-scottPathwaysRelapseTreatment2005" role="doc-biblioref">Scott et al., 2005</a>; <a href="#ref-witkiewitzModelingComplexityPosttreatment2007a" role="doc-biblioref">Witkiewitz &amp; Marlatt, 2007</a>)</span>. This requires constant monitoring over time and timely intervention when necessary.</p>
<p>Importantly, the machine learning models should also predict well among individuals from disadvantaged groups. One of the key benefits of DTx is that they partially address barriers utilizing professional help by providing 24/7/365, affordable, personalized support. They are particularly beneficial to marginalized groups who have low rates of utilizing treatment options due to these treatment barriers. However, they might exacerbate health inequity if embedded algorithms perform relatively worse for less privileged groups. To improve algorithm fairness among different demographic subgroups, the models can incorporate a diverse representation of sample to complete model training. On the other hand, the models should derive more “fair” features. For example, models might be biased if they leverage theory-driven features only. These features might be biased against disadvantaged groups because they depend on decades of research on White males.</p>
<p>To develop such algorithms, we must first identify a clinically relevant outcome to predict. This outcome should be clearly and precisely defined across individuals, easy to measure, and with high temporal precision. Relapse, which usually refers to the return of a symptomatic behavior, is hard to quantify due to its multidimensional nature and temporal coarseness <span class="citation" data-cites="millerWhatRelapseFifty1996">(<a href="#ref-millerWhatRelapseFifty1996" role="doc-biblioref">Miller, 1996</a>)</span>. One potential conceptualization of alcohol relapse is linked to problems of use. Nonetheless, negative consequences are multifaceted and can therefore be burdensome to collect. It is also unclear what the onset of problems are. Another possible outcome is quantity of alcohol use. However, this measure is not temporally precise because there will be a time lag between onset of drinking and the last drink completed. Levels of drinking might also mean differently for individuals with different AUD severity, which makes it hardly generalizable across individuals. Alternatively, in this study, we utilize lapse (i.e., a single episode of alcohol use) as our primary outcome variable. Lapses are easy to define, have a clear onset, and are also clinically meaningful. They can serve as an early warning sign of failure to sustain a desired behavioral change <span class="citation" data-cites="chungRelapseAlcoholOther2006a marlattRelapsePreventionMaintenance2005a">(<a href="#ref-chungRelapseAlcoholOther2006a" role="doc-biblioref">Chung &amp; Maisto, 2006</a>; <a href="#ref-marlattRelapsePreventionMaintenance2005a" role="doc-biblioref">Marlatt &amp; Donovan, 2005</a>)</span>. Research has also shown that initial lapse and frequent lapses are the associated with enhanced risk of relapse <span class="citation" data-cites="witkiewitzRelapsePreventionAlcohol2004b hogstrombrandtPredictionSingleEpisodes1999a">(<a href="#ref-hogstrombrandtPredictionSingleEpisodes1999a" role="doc-biblioref">Högström Brandt et al., 1999</a>; <a href="#ref-witkiewitzRelapsePreventionAlcohol2004b" role="doc-biblioref">Witkiewitz &amp; Marlatt, 2004</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Next, we need to determine what inputs to use for our prediction model. The features should be easy to measure and feasible. The widespread availability of smartphones has rendered constant data collection with DTx attainable. Data collection procedure should not be unduly burdensome to users to ensure that sensing is sustainable. Previous research has established satisfying acceptability of active self-report measures such as EMA and even more willingness to use passive sensing measures <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMachineLearningModels2024">(<a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2024" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al., 2024</a>)</span>. The features should also be well-validated. For example, GPS tracking has high accuracy in locating individuals and is temporally precise. Text sensing captures precisely the interactions between users and other individuals via SMS.</p>
<p>Smart DTx algorithms should also incorporate features that are interpretable and can map on to current interventions. Exemplary features that are highly interpretable include those derived from the theory-driven approach. These features are easy to interpret and closely align with established therapies. For example, features related to social relationship might have important implications for family or marital counseling. Affect state features might be informative of emotion-focused therapy. In addition to selecting interpretable features during data training, computational methods can also be used to enhance model interpretability by analyzing feature importance. For instance, we can examine global feature importance to determine which features contribute the most to predict lapses across individuals. Further, examining local feature importance (i.e., features influencing a single observation) in these models might also be helpful for model interpretation. They have benefits of identifying the factors that contribute to lapse risk for any specific person and moment in time.</p>

<section id="recent-progress-in-smart-dtx" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recent-progress-in-smart-dtx">Recent progress in smart DTx</h2>
<p>Machine learning models leveraging ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measures have performed relatively well to predict goal-inconsistent alcohol use (e.g., lapses). Our group developed an XGBoost machine learning model using self-reported craving, affect, efficacy, risky situations, stressful events, pleasant events to predict alcohol lapses in the next hour, day, or week <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMachineLearningModels2024">(<a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2024" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al., 2024</a>)</span>. The surveys were collected up to four times daily for three months. The model achieved exceptional performance when predicting lapses for new individuals, with a mean auROC score of .89, .90 and .93 for the hour-, day-, and week-level model respectively. Global feature importance demonstrated that past alcohol use and future self-efficacy consistently contributed greatly across all models to predict lapses.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, relying on EMA measures for model building is associated with several limitations. First, constantly completing surveys makes it burdensome for real-world DTx use. Although most EMA relevant mental health research demonstrated modest compliance rates, their time windows last from two weeks to three months <span class="citation" data-cites="porras-segoviaSmartphonebasedEcologicalMomentary2020 czyzEcologicalAssessmentDaily2018 vangenugtenExperiencedBurdenAdherence2020a mackesy-amitiFeasibilityEcologicalMomentary2018 hungSmartphonebasedEcologicalMomentary2016">(<a href="#ref-czyzEcologicalAssessmentDaily2018" role="doc-biblioref">Czyz et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-hungSmartphonebasedEcologicalMomentary2016" role="doc-biblioref">Hung et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-mackesy-amitiFeasibilityEcologicalMomentary2018" role="doc-biblioref">Mackesy-Amiti &amp; Boodram, 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-porras-segoviaSmartphonebasedEcologicalMomentary2020" role="doc-biblioref">Porras-Segovia et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-vangenugtenExperiencedBurdenAdherence2020a" role="doc-biblioref">van Genugten et al., 2020</a>)</span>. The study length is insufficient for real-world DTx use. As extended period of time of app use is anticipated, users’ perceived burden of answering surveys is presumably larger <span class="citation" data-cites="mogkImplementationWorkflowStrategies2023">(<a href="#ref-mogkImplementationWorkflowStrategies2023" role="doc-biblioref">Mogk et al., 2023</a>)</span>. This is particularly problematic as AUD is a chronic disease that requires constant risk monitoring. Although minimizing the number of items in the surveys and the frequency of prompting users to complete the surveys might help mitigate the associated burden, it can inevitably reduce the prediction precision and temporal precision of algorithms.</p>
<p>Second, decisions regarding what constructs to assess and what items to include to assess these constructs are limited by theory and past data. Given this, we might miss important constructs that predict lapses among individuals from groups that have been less well-studied. Including risk factors solely drawn from decades of research on White, male-dominant samples might even exacerbate health disparities when applied to DTx. Further, our current understanding of alcohol relapse precursors is not comprehensive. For example, Marlatt’s proposed taxonomy characterizes high-risk situational precursors to alcohol relapse such as social pressure and positive/negative emotional state <span class="citation" data-cites="marlattTaxonomyHighriskSituations1996a">(<a href="#ref-marlattTaxonomyHighriskSituations1996a" role="doc-biblioref">Marlatt, 1996</a>)</span>. Nonetheless, replication studies have found this theoretical framework to be somewhat unreliable and have low predictive validity of post-treatment outcomes <span class="citation" data-cites="lowmanReplicationExtensionMarlatt1996a stoutPredictiveValidityMarlatt1996 kaddenMarlattRelapseTaxonomy1996">(<a href="#ref-kaddenMarlattRelapseTaxonomy1996" role="doc-biblioref">Kadden, 1996</a>; <a href="#ref-lowmanReplicationExtensionMarlatt1996a" role="doc-biblioref">Lowman et al., 1996</a>; <a href="#ref-stoutPredictiveValidityMarlatt1996" role="doc-biblioref">Stout et al., 1996</a>)</span>. A review study also suggests that current relapse factors are not well-understood in past research due to methodological constraints and a death of “near real-time” data <span class="citation" data-cites="mckayConceptualMethodologicalAnalytical2006b">(<a href="#ref-mckayConceptualMethodologicalAnalytical2006b" role="doc-biblioref">McKay et al., 2006</a>)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="incorporating-sms-in-smart-dtx" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="incorporating-sms-in-smart-dtx">Incorporating SMS in smart DTx</h2>
<p>Text sensing technology, which is both feasible and sustainable, represents new opportunities in DTx that might address limitations of the current active reporting approach. Since AUD is a chronic condition requiring ongoing risk monitoring over an extended period, DTx can benefit from SMS sensing because it places a low burden on users and allows for continuous data collection. Studies collecting passive data have demonstrated high acceptability from participants and higher compliance rates compared to active measures <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantAcceptabilityPersonalSensing2023a beukenhorstUsingSmartphonesReduce2022a">(<a href="#ref-beukenhorstUsingSmartphonesReduce2022a" role="doc-biblioref">Beukenhorst et al., 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-wyantAcceptabilityPersonalSensing2023a" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al., 2023</a>)</span>. Further, risk monitoring using SMS sensing is temporally sensitive to fluctuating risks. Analyzing text messages can detect potential triggers in time without actively prompting users to reflect on their feelings at the moment or report their environment.</p>
<p>Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) is a well-established text analysis tool that can potentially work well to predict alcohol lapses. It counts the frequency of words that fall into different categories to analyze a variety texts <span class="citation" data-cites="pennebakerDevelopmentPsychometricProperties2015a">(<a href="#ref-pennebakerDevelopmentPsychometricProperties2015a" role="doc-biblioref">Pennebaker et al., 2015</a>)</span>. LIWC might have good performance because they allow researchers to mine previously established robust construct of alcohol lapse precursors. It involves domain-specific knowledge of known risks for alcohol lapses. For instance, the majority of an inpatient teen sample reported initial relapse to alcohol when offered alcohol, when in negative state, and when in interpersonal conflicts <span class="citation" data-cites="brownCharacteristicsRelapseFollowing1989">(<a href="#ref-brownCharacteristicsRelapseFollowing1989" role="doc-biblioref">Brown et al., 1989</a>)</span>. Other commonly found risk factors include alcohol craving <span class="citation" data-cites="mckayStudiesFactorsRelapse1999a korlakuntaReasonsRelapsePatients2012">(<a href="#ref-korlakuntaReasonsRelapsePatients2012" role="doc-biblioref">Korlakunta et al., 2012-07/2012-12</a>; <a href="#ref-mckayStudiesFactorsRelapse1999a" role="doc-biblioref">McKay, 1999</a>)</span>, negative affect state <span class="citation" data-cites="mckayStudiesFactorsRelapse1999a">(<a href="#ref-mckayStudiesFactorsRelapse1999a" role="doc-biblioref">McKay, 1999</a>)</span>, cognitive factors <span class="citation" data-cites="mckayStudiesFactorsRelapse1999a">(<a href="#ref-mckayStudiesFactorsRelapse1999a" role="doc-biblioref">McKay, 1999</a>)</span>, and interpersonal problem <span class="citation" data-cites="mckayStudiesFactorsRelapse1999a">(<a href="#ref-mckayStudiesFactorsRelapse1999a" role="doc-biblioref">McKay, 1999</a>)</span>. LIWC might be capable of mining those risk-relevant factors because it incorporates a dictionary of words associated with social processes, affect, and substances.</p>
<p>Models leveraging LIWC can also benefit from the word categories that have not been explored in past research (e.g., pronouns, clout). This approach is less susceptible to our knowledge gap and might even be capable of identifying unrecognized risk factors for alcohol lapses. We might even expect less differential performance under the bottom up approach across privileged vs.&nbsp;unprivileged groups because the features are not drawn from past research dominated by White males with AUD and are thus potentially unbiased towards privileged groups.</p>
<p>Text analysis also offers avenues for model interpretation to yield valuable insights into treatment recommendations. LIWC can generate features that are highly interpretable and some might even relate to extant interventions. Assessing their feature importance helps us understand how features contribute to the models (i.e., which features are robust in predicting lapses). For example, global feature importance can identify robust predictors across individuals in predicting lapses. Local feature importance provides insights on what contributes to a lapse for a specific person at a specific time. They can be useful in personalized treatment recommendations.</p>
</section>
<section id="current-study" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="current-study">Current Study</h2>
<p>In the current study, we ran participants text messages over a period of three months feature engineering techniques through the LIWC program. We used generated features as inputs to models that predict alcohol lapses. We evaluated both model performance and interpretability of each distinct method. Followings are the more specific aims:</p>
<p><strong>Aim 1: Train and evaluate performance of machine learning models using language features derived from LIWC to predict alcohol lapses.</strong> We used LIWC to engineer features from raw SMS messages. For each distinct feature set derived from a variety of configurations, we trained machine learning models a contemporary statistical algorithms (XGBoost). We evaluated and statistically compared the model performance, quantified as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC).</p>
<p><strong>Aim 2: Identify important features and evaluate their interpretability with respect to recommending interventions.</strong> Model interpretation is key to providing treatment recommendations and uncovering potential causes of lapses. We used contemporary approaches to quantify feature importance (e.g., SHAP) of features within each of the NLP techniques used.</p>
<p><strong>Aim 3: Examine model fairness in historically underprivileged subgroup populations.</strong> It is also important to note that if embedded algorithms perform relatively worse for marginalized groups, their use can exacerbate rather than alleviate treatment disparities. As such, model performance between privileged vs.&nbsp;unprivileged groups should be carefully examined. We evaluated model performance in demographic subgroups that face excessive barriers accessing alcohol treatments or medications, including females, racial minorities, individuals living under poverty, and older population.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This study analyzed data collected from 2017-2019 from a larger grant funded by National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (R01 AA024391). In this paper, we focus on methods and measures that are relevant to this study. Additional details on broader methods and the full set of measures collected are described elsewhere (see https://osf.io/w5h9y/ and <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMachineLearningModels2024 wyantAcceptabilityPersonalSensing2023a">(<a href="#ref-wyantAcceptabilityPersonalSensing2023a" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al., 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2024" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al., 2024</a>)</span>).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="participants">Participants</h2>
<p>Individuals in early recovery from AUD were recruited from Madison and surrounding area via social media platforms (e.g., Facebook), referrals from clinics, and television and radio advertisements. After initial phone screen, interested individuals came in-person to complete a more in-depth screening to determine their eligibility. We documented their demographic information. Inclusion criteria include that participants: 1) must be at least aged 18 or older; 2) must meet criteria for AUD with at least moderate severity (&gt;four DSM-5 criteria); 3) must be abstinent from alcohol for at least one week and fewer than two months at time of intake; 4) must be able to read and write in English; 5) must be willing to use smartphone and their smartphone is compatible with our study technology. Participants were excluded if they have a lifetime history of severe and persistent mental illness. One hundred sixty-nine participants were eligible and enrolled in the study. After excluding participants who discontinued before the first follow-up session and those with low compliance rates and too few messages (&lt;100 messages), we have a final sample size of 138 participants.</p>

<section id="procedures" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="procedures">Procedures</h2>
<p>The study lasted up to three months with five in-person visits (see <a href="#fig-simp" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>). Participants completed an in-person screening visit to determine their eligibility, obtain their informed consent, and collect their demographic information and self-report measures. They then completed an intake session one week later and three follow-up visits afterwards spaced at one-month intervals. During each of the follow-up visits, a research assistant downloaded participants’ SMS messages from their phone, verified reports of lapses and queried participants about any additional unreported laspes. Additional self-reported measures were obtained (see https://osf.io/w5h9y/).</p>
<p>Throughout the course of the study, participants were expected to complete four daily EMAs that asked about their alcohol cravings, risky situations, stressful/pleasant events, etc <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMachineLearningModels2024">(<a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2024" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al., 2024</a>)</span>. Notably, in the first item in the EMA survey, participants also reported their past alcohol use. Answer to this item will be used as the predicted outcome (see <em>Section Alcohol Lapses</em>).</p>

<p>Participants were prompted up to four times daily to report their recent alcohol use. In the first item of each daily EMA survey, dates and times of any unreported past alcohol use were obtained. Reports of past alcohol use were used as a dichotomous outcome variable (Lapse vs.&nbsp;No Lapse). We predicted alcohol lapses in the next 24-hour window (i.e., next day lapse prediction). Every outcome window started from 4 a.m. everyday and end 24 hours later.</p>
</section>
<section id="sms-messages" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sms-messages">SMS Messages</h3>
<p>At each of the follow-up visits, a research assistant downloaded the participants’ SMS message logs from their phone. These logs included the message type (incoming vs.&nbsp;outgoing), date and time sent/received, text body, contact name, whether the participants read the text or not, etc. Images and voice texts were excluded from analysis. Both group messages and one-on-one messages were obtained from participants’ phones. We included only messages from/to important contacts and in group chats.</p>
<p>For each individual lapse window, we had predictor sets that differ in prediction window length and their analytic unit. We defined text prediction windows to be 3-day and 1-week preceding the lapse window (see <a href="#fig-window" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a>). We analyzed the two prediction windows both individually and combined (i.e., three configurations in total).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feature-engineering">Feature Engineering</h3>
<p>Text messages served as the only raw source for all feature engineering. The document sets (varying based on unit of analysis) went through a generic pre-processing step that involves removal of all emojis. Our decision to remove all emojis was due to loss of emoji data in the ios devices during back up. This study used the LIWC dictionary <span class="citation" data-cites="pennebakerDevelopmentPsychometricProperties2015a">(<a href="#ref-pennebakerDevelopmentPsychometricProperties2015a" role="doc-biblioref">Pennebaker et al., 2015</a>)</span> and computed scores by counting frequency of words that belong to each category. We did not remove any stop words. LIWC aligns with the current alcohol relapse risk factor literature in that it examines psychometric properties including cognitive state and social processes <span class="citation" data-cites="brownCharacteristicsRelapseFollowing1989 mckayStudiesFactorsRelapse1999a mckayStudiesFactorsRelapse1999a">(<a href="#ref-brownCharacteristicsRelapseFollowing1989" role="doc-biblioref">Brown et al., 1989</a>; <a href="#ref-mckayStudiesFactorsRelapse1999a" role="doc-biblioref">McKay, 1999</a>, <a href="#ref-mckayStudiesFactorsRelapse1999a" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>We adopted two configurations for analytic units – individual messages and concatenated messages. In the first configuration method, we ran individual messages within the defined prediction window through LIWC. We then normalized LIWC feature scores based on the square root of word counts instead of raw word counts which was the default choice from the program. We applied the normalization on all LIWC categories other than word count, word per sentence, and the four summary measures – analytic, clout, authenticity, and tone. We excluded the four summary categories because their raw scores were not normalized on raw word counts. Our normalization method was chosen due to the relatively short message length for individual messages. We further obtained the median and 95% percentile of normalized LIWC scores for all messages related to each lapse label.</p>
<p>In the other analytic unit configuration, we first concatenated all messages associated with each lapse label altogether. We then obtained LIWC results for the concatenated messages. We further adopted three configurations for normalization methods – normalized on raw word count (i.e., default method from the program), normalized on the square root of word count, and a combination of these two.</p>
</section>
<section id="candidate-algorithm" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="candidate-algorithm">Candidate Algorithm</h3>
<p>We leveraged the XGBoost algorithm that differed on the above three configurations: 1) prediction window length (see <em>Section SMS Messages</em>); 2) analytic units (see <em>Section Feature Engineering</em>); and 3) normalization methods (see <em>Section Feature Engineering</em>). As we have a fairly imbalanced class labels in our dataset (see <em>Section Sample Distribution</em>), we further considered different resampling strategies including upsampling and downsampling with different ratios. Our decision to use the XGBoost algorithm was based on its two benefits. First, the algorithm has demonstrated satisfying performance in classifying lapse vs.&nbsp;no lapse in our lab’s previous work <span class="citation" data-cites="wyantMachineLearningModels2024">(<a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2024" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al., 2024</a>)</span>. We can select the best model from a range of model-specific hyperparameters (mtry, tree depth, and learning rate), on top of the four above manually incorporated configurations. Second, XGBoost is well-suited to calculate Shapley values that can help us understand each feature’s contributions to model output (see <em>Section Feature Importance</em>).</p>
</section>
<section id="model-selection" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-selection">Model Selection</h3>
<p>We performed grouped, nested cross-validations to perform hyperparameter tuning and select the best model configuration. The dataset was participant-grouped so that each individual was assigned to either held-in or held-out set to avoid bias of predicting participants’ lapses using their own data. The nested cross-validation method uses two nested loops to divide folds. In the inner loop, held-out folds were used as a validation set for model selection. In the outer loop, held-out folds were utilized as a test set for model evaluation. We only presented validation results from the 300 sets in the inner loop in this paper because we are still working on model development. We reserved test set to evaluate the overfitting of final full model.</p>
<p>The primary performance metric to select the best model configuration and evaluate the model performance on the test sets was auROC. The auROC measures the probability that a randomly chosen positive case is assigned a higher score than a randomly chosen negative case. It reflects the model’s ability to distinguish between the positive and negative cases across all possible thresholds. Values between .70 and .80 are considered fair, values between .80 and .90 are considered good, and values above .90 are considered excellent. Across all models that differed on the above discussed configurations, the best model was selected based on the highest median auROC across all validation sets (see <em>Section Machine Learning Algorithm</em>).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-evaluation">Model Evaluation</h2>
<section id="performance-evaluation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="performance-evaluation">Performance Evaluation</h3>
<p>We calculated the predicted probability scores for all our observations based on the best model configuration and then obtained the median auROC score across all 300 validation sets in the inner fold. We further performed a Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model to estimate the posterior probability (i.e., the likelihood of achieving the results given out data) distributions of the auROCs. The two random intercepts in the models included the repeat and the fold within repeat. We reported the 95% CIs for our models’ auROCs and determined if they included .5 (chance performance). If this CI included 0.5, we would conclude that our model performed no better than random guess. We also reported the probability that the model auROC is &gt;.05.</p>
</section>
<section id="algorithmic-bias" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="algorithmic-bias">Algorithmic Bias</h3>
<p>A subset of individual characteristic measures was used to evaluate model fairness on subgroups. We compared model performance among each sex, racial, age and income subgroups because the populations face increased barriers obtaining AUD treatments. Stigma among older populations and wome, and economic hardship in racial minority groups can all contribute to low treatment-seeking and alcohol treatment completion <span class="citation" data-cites="dibartoloAlcoholUseDisorder2017 jacobsonRacialDisparitiesCompletion2007 mayBarriersTreatmentAlcohol2019">(<a href="#ref-dibartoloAlcoholUseDisorder2017" role="doc-biblioref">DiBartolo &amp; Jarosinski, 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-jacobsonRacialDisparitiesCompletion2007" role="doc-biblioref">J. O. Jacobson et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-mayBarriersTreatmentAlcohol2019" role="doc-biblioref">May et al., 2019</a>)</span>. Participants younger than 55 years old were considered as a privileged group. We adopted half of median income in Madison area in 2017 as cut-off to assign participants to income groups.</p>
<p>We performed a Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model that regressed the auROCs from the 300 validation sets in the inner loop as a function of group membership (privileged group vs.&nbsp;unprivileged group within each of above individual characteristics). We reported the 95% CI for model performance differences and examined if they included 0. If this CI did not include 0, we would conclude that our model was unfair. We also reported the probability that the difference is greater than zero.</p>
</section>
<section id="feature-importance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feature-importance">Feature Importance</h3>
<p>We also calculated SHAP values to interpret the results. SHAP is a game theory based method to explain how each feature influences the model output <span class="citation" data-cites="lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017">(<a href="#ref-lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017" role="doc-biblioref">Lundberg &amp; Lee, 2017</a>)</span>. It assigns importance to each feature, where a positive feature importance positively affects the model output. This methodology can be applied to any machine learning algorithm and can increase model transparency and interpretability. Local Shapley values explain factors that contribute to a single observation, and global Shapley values represent feature importance across all observations. To compute global Shapley values, we averaged the absolute value of all local Shapley values. For better understanding, we aggregated Shapley values for each LIWC category, regardless of their prediction window and normalization methods.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="liwc-features">LIWC Features</h2>
<p>We obtained LIWC scores from 117 linguistic categories. These categories include total word count, number of words per sentence, the four summary categories (analytic, clout, authentic, and tone), and other linguistic categories such as social and pronouns. Notably, LIWC-22 now incorporates a <em>health</em> dimension that includes phrases related to illness, wellness, mental health (diagnoses or behaviors), and substances. For each unit of analysis, we had 468 engineered features after normalization and aggregation (see <em>Section Feature Engineering</em>).</p>
<p>When our unit of analysis was on individual messages (see <a href="#tbl-panel" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;3</a> and <a href="#fig-liwc_ind" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;7</a>), the median of all median LIWC feature scores excluding the six unnormalized categories within each 3-day prediction window ranged from 0.00 to 2.45 (median = 0.00, sd = 0.34). The median of all median LIWC feature scores excluding the six unnormalized categories within each 1-week prediction window ranged from 0.00 to 2.45 (median = 0.00, sd = 0.35). The max of all median LIWC feature scores excluding the six unnormalized categories within each 3-day prediction window ranged from 0.00 to 11.58 (median = 0.80, sd = 1.60). The max of all median LIWC feature scores excluding the six unnormalized categories within each 1-week prediction window ranged from 0.00 to 8.89 (median = 0.63, sd = 1.25).</p>
<p>The median of all 95% percentile LIWC feature scores excluding the six unnormalized categories within each 3-day prediction window ranged from 0.00 to 4.74 (median = 0.30, sd = 0.70). The median of all 95% percentile LIWC feature scores excluding the six unnormalized categories within each 1-week prediction window ranged from 0.00 to 4.89 (median = 0.34, sd = 0.72). The max of all 95% percentile LIWC feature scores excluding the six unnormalized categories within each 3-day prediction window ranged from 0.36 to 17.51 (median = 1.15, sd = 2.40). The max of all 95% percentile LIWC feature scores excluding the six unnormalized categories within each 1-week prediction window ranged from 0.35 to 18.42 (median = 1.00, sd = 2.47).</p>

<p>The best model configuration was the one that leveraged raw LWIC scores from concatenated messages within both the 3-day and 1-week prediction window, and an upsampling technique with a ratio of 1:1. We applied the best configuration on the raw dataset and obtained an auROC score of 0.53 (see <a href="#fig-auroc" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;10</a> for the ROC curve). We further aggregated predictions by folds, and the median score of all median auROCs across the 300 inner folds was 0.53 (sd = 0.09, range = 0.28 - 0.80; see <a href="#fig-auroc_hist" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;11</a>). The median posterior distribution of the auROCs was 0.53 (95% CI = [0.52, 0.54]; see <a href="#fig-auroc_posterior" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;12</a>). The probability of the posterior auROC larger than .5 was 1.00. We concluded that our model was better than chance performance.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-fairness">Model Fairness</h2>
<p>73 (53%) participants are females, 17 (12%) are non-White minorities, 39 (28%) earned less than half of the median income in Madison in Year 2017, and 13 (9%) aged 55 or older (see <a href="#fig-demographics" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;13</a>). Our model performed consistently worse in unprivileged group vs.&nbsp;privileged group across all four demographic categories (see <a href="#fig-fairness" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;14</a> and <a href="#tbl-fairness" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;5</a>). The median of posterior distribution of model performance difference was 0.03 (95%CI = [0.01, 0.06]) for White people compared to People of Color. The probability of the performance for the White people higher than for People of Color was 0.99. The posterior distribution of performance differences also indicated that the model performed better in males than in females (median = 0.02, 95%CI = [0.01, 0.04], probability = 1.00), in people younger than 55 than people older than 55 (median = 0.04, 95%CI = [0.01, 0.07], probability = 1.00), and in people that have higher income than in those who have lower income (median = 0.02, 95%CI = [0.00, 0.04], probability = 0.99). We concluded that the model performed significantly worse in unprivileged groups.</p>

<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>Overall, our best machine learning model configuration leveraging linguistic categories from SMS messages to predict a single episode of alcohol lapse achieved an auROC score of .53. Our model was able to extract signal from text messages. Nonetheless, the .03 increase beyond chance performance is not sufficient enough for any clinical use.</p>
<p>Our LIWC model was only planned to serve as a baseline model against which to later compare my sophisticated approaches following the FYP. Clearly, more robust features need to be engineered from SMS messages to achieve better prediction. <!--I think you want to pivot away from liwc pretty quickly.   How can you vary prediction window length furhter?  If you go any shorter than 3 day there is too much missing data.  Are you talking about longer? Not sure that makes sense either--> Our next plan is to explore other more sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) techniques to train our models. In addition to the current configurations varying in prediction window length, we might also incorporate configurations such as message types.</p>
<p>To improve model performance, we might consider subsetting messages based on their types. For instance, we can analyze incoming and outgoing messages individually. By distinguishing between the two, we might get a more refined understanding of communication dynamics. For example, incoming messages might indicate the level of social support one gets and outgoing messages might reflect their level of self-disclosure and willingness to seek help. In the current study, we have taken a different approach that combined the two message types together. Although it provides an overview of social interactions between participants and their contacts, it might overlook some nuanced distinctions underlying texts from those two message types. On the other hand, it is important to emphasize potential drawbacks to separate the two message types, especially given the limited number of messages (see <em>Section Sample Distribution</em>) associated with each label. It might lead to the problem of data sparsity which might even exacerbate model performance and decrease its generalizability. We might consider extended prediction window (e.g., 1-week window only) to aggregate more data.</p>
<p>We can further try a variety of other natural language processing (NLP) techniques for feature engineering including topic modeling, sentiment analysis, n-grams approach and word embeddings. Our next and second baseline model can be an n-grams approach. It represents bags-of-words occurrences inside a document. We can leverage term frequency, inverse document frequency and a combination of the two to mine word importance inside a document. As this method yields high-dimensional data, we might also consider combining it with dimension reduction approaches to do feature engineering. Other NLP methods we might try include topic modeling. It is an unsupervised machine learning methods to identify clusters of topics in a body of text. We can also try other Sentiment Analysis methods, beyond LIWC’s native affect and emotion categories which focus mostly on valence. For example, we might infer the emotional underpinning of texts in terms of basic emotion categories (e.g., anger, fear) from SMS messages. There are also other sentiment analysis approaches outside of LIWC that can handle modifier words and provide sentence level rather than word level analysis. We can also utilize word embeddings—vectors that represent relationships of words within a document in a lower-dimension.</p>
<p>Note that these feature engineering techniques differ in their interpretability. Word embeddings is empirically-driven and its features that are less interpretable. <!--n grams is pretty interpretable.  Depends some on what words predict but I wouldnt offer it up an an exmple of a non-interpretable approahc--> The interpretability of n-grams can depend on the presence of words that contain high global importance. Topic modeling, though data-driven, might yield topic clusters that are interpretable. Sentiment Analysis can yield features that are highly interpretable and might map on to current interventions. Importantly, our desired predictive model should not just be the one that has the highest predictive ability. We should also examine whether our model is interpretable enough to understand intervention-relevant risk factors. This helps us determine if our model can be clinically useful.</p>
<p>The minimal signal we detected in SMS messages might also reflect that text messages itself is not an effective data source to predict lapses. One potential reason might include that most people do not engage in enough SMS texting behaviors that produce meaningful patterns near the time of lapsing. Some people might also not use text messaging as their main source of communication. Some might have preferences for texting in other platforms (e.g., WhatsApp, Snapchat). The lack of sufficient data points curtails machine learning models’ ability to detect risk-relevant signals. To enhance model performance, we might need increased access to texts from other sources. Additionally, text messages might not convey information indicative of risk-relevant factors such as alcohol cravings <span class="citation" data-cites="mckayStudiesFactorsRelapse1999a korlakuntaReasonsRelapsePatients2012 wyantMachineLearningModels2024">(<a href="#ref-korlakuntaReasonsRelapsePatients2012" role="doc-biblioref">Korlakunta et al., 2012-07/2012-12</a>; <a href="#ref-mckayStudiesFactorsRelapse1999a" role="doc-biblioref">McKay, 1999</a>; <a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2024" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al., 2024</a>)</span>. Communications in SMS messages might involve casual and monotonous interactions which lacks specificity to effectively predict lapses.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can explore adoption of metadata from text messages and voice calls as predictive features. Those metadata include number of messages within a prediction window, contextual information related to the contact person, timing of messages or calls, etc. We can mine sudden changes to messaging or calling behaviors from those metadata that might signal enhanced lapse risks. For example, an increased number of late night outgoing messages might indicate a sudden mood change preceding a lapse. Note that we have already witnessed some success in our lab’s previous work (see Kendra’s FYP), with auROCs in mid to upper .60s.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, despite the low performance score, we still witnessed consistent unfairness in our algorithm for unprivileged demographic subgroups. One key factor that contributed to the model biases might be the disproportionate representation of subgroups such as racial minorities. To address this limitation, we might recruit a sample with a fair distribution of people with diverse backgrounds. Importantly, however, our model still systematically misrepresented other demographic subgroups even if they were well-represented in our training data. The other explanation might be that our features were inherently biased against subgroups. People from different demographic groups might display different language styles, and LIWC might be more attuned to those from the majority groups. As such, we should further try other natural language processing techniques that incorporate more fair features. For example, topic modeling does not rely on theories built upon past, White male-dominated research and might yield more fair features.</p>
<p>Results in this study indicate that text message might not be potentially valuable raw data source in predicting alcohol lapses in AUD patients. Although SMS messages offer the benefits of minimal burden on users, this advantage cannot compensate for their low prediction precision. EMA measures, despite their somewhat higher burden, are capable of capturing robust signals. GPS sensing, which is also not burdensome, can obtain some signals with little feature engineering (see Claire’s FYP). Note that both EMA and GPS sensing are easily accessible across platforms. Nonetheless, as SMS is not currently available in ios platform, we might have diminished further interest in this data source.</p>
<p>In sum, our machine learning algorithm had minimal increase in performance compared to random guess. The results call for further exploration of other feature engineering techniques to build models that have higher performance, are interpretable and have low algorithmic biases.</p>
