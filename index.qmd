# Introduction

# Methods

## Overview
This study analyzed data collected from 2017-2019 from a larger grant funded by National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (R01 AA024391). In this paper, we focus on methods and measures that are relevant to this study. Additional details on broader methods and the full set of measures collected are described elsewhere (see https://osf.io/w5h9y/ and [@wyantMachineLearningModels2024; @wyantAcceptabilityPersonalSensing2023a]).

## Participants

Individuals in early recovery from AUD were recruited from Madison and surrounding area via social media platforms (e.g., Facebook), referrals from clinics, and television and radio advertisements. After initial phone screen, interested individuals came in-person to complete a more in-depth screening to determine their eligibility. We documented their demographic information. Inclusion criteria include that participants: 1) must be at least aged 18 or older; 2) must meet criteria for AUD with at least moderate severity (\>four DSM-5 criteria); 3) must be abstinent from alcohol for at least one week and fewer than two months at time of intake; 4) must be able to read and write in English; 5) must be willing to use smartphone and their smartphone is compatible with our study technology. Participants were excluded if they have a lifetime history of severe and persistent mental illness. One hundred sixty-nine participants were eligible and enrolled in the study. After excluding participants who discontinued before the first follow-up session and those with low compliance rates and too few communications (\<100 messages), we have a final sample size of 150 participants.

## Procedures

The study lasted up to three months with five in-person visits. Participants completed an in-person screening visit to determine their eligibility, obtain their informed consent, and collect their demographic information and self-report measures. They then completed an intake session one week later and three follow-up visits afterwards spaced at one-month intervals. During each of the follow-up visits, a research assistant downloaded participants' SMS messages from their phone, verified reports of lapses and queried participants about any additional unreported laspes. Additional self-reported measures were obtained (see https://osf.io/w5h9y/).

Throughout the course of the study, participants were expected to complete four daily EMAs that asked about their alcohol cravings, risky situations, stressful/pleasant events, etc [@wyantMachineLearningModels2024]. Notably, in the first item in the EMA survey, participants also reported their past alcohol use. Answer to this item will be used as the predicted outcome.
