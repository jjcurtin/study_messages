  abstract = {Despite high mortality rates due to opioid overdose and excessive alcohol consumption, medications for the treatment of alcohol and opioid use disorder have not been widely used in the USA. This paper provides an overview of the literature on the availability of alcohol and opioid used disorder medications in the specialty substance use disorder treatment system, other treatment settings and systems, and among providers with a federal waiver to prescribe buprenorphine. We also present the most current data on the availability of alcohol and opioid use disorder medications in the USA. These estimates show steady growth in availability of opioid use disorder medications over the past decade and a decline in availability of alcohol use disorder medications. However, overall use of medications in the USA remains low. In 2017, only 16.3\% of specialty treatment programs offered any single medication for alcohol use disorder treatment and 35.5\% offered any single medication for opioid use disorder treatment. Availability of buprenorphine-waivered providers has increased significantly since 2002. However, geographic disparities in access to buprenorphine remain. Some of the most promising strategies to increase availability of alcohol and opioid use disorder medications include the following: incorporating substance use disorder training in healthcare education programs, educating the substance use disorder workforce about the benefits of medication treatment, reducing stigma surrounding the use of medications, implementing medications in primary care settings, implementing integrated care models, revising regulations on methadone and buprenorphine, improving health insurance coverage of medications, and developing novel medications for the treatment of substance use disorder.},

  abstract = {Alcohol misuse is present in over a quarter of trauma patients. Information in the clinical notes of the electronic health record of trauma patients may be used for phenotyping tasks with natural language processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning. The objective of this study is to train and validate an NLP classifier for identifying patients with alcohol misuse.An observational cohort of 1422 adult patients admitted to a trauma center between April 2013 and November 2016. Linguistic processing of clinical notes was performed using the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System. The primary analysis was the binary classification of alcohol misuse. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test served as the reference standard.The data corpus comprised 91\,045 electronic health record notes and 16\,091 features. In the final machine learning classifier, 16 features were selected from the first 24 hours of notes for identifying alcohol misuse. The classifier's performance in the validation cohort had an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.78 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.85). Sensitivity and specificity were at 56.0\% (95\% CI, 44.1\% to 68.0\%) and 88.9\% (95\% CI, 84.4\% to 92.8\%). The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test demonstrates the classifier fits the data well (P\,=\,.17). A simpler rule-based keyword approach had a decrease in sensitivity when compared with the NLP classifier from 56.0\% to 18.2\%.The NLP classifier has adequate predictive validity for identifying alcohol misuse in trauma centers. External validation is needed before its application to augment screening.},

  abstract = {Background and aims The experience of alcohol use among adolescents is complex, with international differences in age of purchase and individual differences in consumption and consequences. This latter underlines the importance of prediction modeling of adolescent alcohol use. The current study (a) compared the performance of seven machine-learning algorithms to predict different levels of alcohol use in mid-adolescence and (b) used a cross-cultural cross-study scheme in the training-validation-test process to display the predictive power of the best performing machine-learning algorithm. Design A comparison of seven machine-learning algorithms: logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, neural network, lasso regression, ridge regression and elastic-net. Setting Canada and Australia. Participants The Canadian sample is part of a 4-year follow-up (2012--16) of the Co-Venture cohort (n = 3826, baseline age 12.8 {\textpm} 0.4, 49.2\% girls). The Australian sample is part of a 3-year follow-up (2012--15) of the Climate Schools and Preventure (CAP) cohort (n = 2190, baseline age 13.3 {\textpm} 0.3, 43.7\% girls). Measurements The algorithms used several prediction indices, such as F1 prediction score, accuracy, precision, recall, negative predictive value and area under the curve (AUC). Findings Based on prediction indices, the elastic-net machine-learning algorithm showed the best predictive performance in both Canadian (AUC = 0.869 {\textpm} 0.066) and Australian (AUC = 0.855 {\textpm} 0.072) samples. Domain contribution analysis showed that the highest prediction accuracy indices yielded from models with only psychopathology (AUC = 0.816 {\textpm} 0.044/0.790 {\textpm} 0.071 in Canada/Australia) and only personality clusters (AUC = 0.776 {\textpm} 0.063/0.796 {\textpm} 0.066 in Canada/Australia). Similarly, regardless of the level of alcohol use, in both samples, externalizing psychopathologies, alcohol use at baseline and the sensation-seeking personality profile contributed to the prediction. Conclusions Computerized screening software shows promise in predicting the risk of alcohol use among adolescents.},

OBJECTIVES: The research presented here examines the extent to which the percent of heavy drinkers and percent of abstainers in one's social network moderates the effectiveness of a brief motivational intervention with and without a telephone booster on alcohol use among trauma patients. METHOD: Secondary data analyses were conducted using data from 596 participants (456males) who were recruited from three urban Level I trauma centers. Patients were randomized to one of the three intervention conditions: brief advice (BA; n~=~200), brief motivational intervention (BMI; n~=~203), and BMI with a telephone booster (BMI~+~B; n~=~193). For the purpose of the present study, measures of alcohol-specific social network characteristics at baseline and alcohol use at 3- and 6-month follow-up were used. RESULTS: At low percentages (0\% to {\textasciitilde}7\%) of people in one's social network who are heavy drinkers, there was a negative, statistically significant effect of the BMI conditions versus the BA condition on alcohol use. However, percent of abstainers did not moderate the effects of the BMI conditions. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the BMI and BMI~+~B conditions may be most effective among patients with no heavy drinkers in their social networks. BMIs may benefit from including a component that addresses having one or more heavy drinkers in one's social network.},

However, alcohol use information is buried in the patient's clinical records, and extracting this information from narrative text requires substantial manual labor. This work aims to develop an automated system for detecting alcohol use status from patients' discharge summaries. A combination of machine learning and rule-based techniques has been employed in order to identify alcohol status in three stages. In the first stage, the proposed system detects alcohol-related sentences by utilizing a keyword search technique. The second stage distinguishes between the negative and positive alcohol sentences and identifies the temporal status. In this stage different machine learning classifiers have been employed in order to achieve the best performance. Finally, the document level alcohol use status is aggregated from the sentence-level for each patient's record. The proposed system exhibits high performance in identifying alcohol use status, achieving an Fl-score up to 0.99 in identifying alcohol use related records, 0.96 in detecting negative records and 0.89 identifying temporal status.},

  abstract = {Statistical inference often fails to replicate. One reason is that many results may be selected for drawing inference because some threshold of a statistic like the P-value was crossed, leading to biased reported effect sizes. Nonetheless, considerable non-replication is to be expected even without selective reporting, and generalizations from single studies are rarely if ever warranted. Honestly reported results must vary from replication to replication because of varying assumption violations and random variation; excessive agreement itself would suggest deeper problems, such as failure to publish results in conflict with group expectations or desires. A general perception of a ``replication crisis'' may thus reflect failure to recognize that statistical tests not only test hypotheses, but countless assumptions and the entire environment in which research takes place. Because of all the uncertain and unknown assumptions that underpin statistical inferences, we should treat inferential statistics as highly unstable local descriptions of relations between assumptions and data, rather than as providing generalizable inferences about hypotheses or models. And that means we should treat statistical results as being much more incomplete and uncertain than is currently the norm. Acknowledging this uncertainty could help reduce the allure of selective reporting: Since a small P-value could be large in a replication study, and a large P-value could be small, there is simply no need to selectively report studies based on statistical results. Rather than focusing our study reports on uncertain conclusions, we should thus focus on describing accurately how the study was conducted, what problems occurred, what data were obtained, what analysis methods were used and why, and what output those methods produced.},

  abstract = {AIMS: The main aim was to investigate the relative roles of mental distress and intrinsic motivation for relapse after inpatient substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, while adjusting for demographics and treatment variables. METHODS: The study is based on a prospective multicenter study with a baseline gross sample of 607 patients with SUD (response rate\,=\,84\%) admitted to an inpatient stay at one of five specialized SUD treatment centers in Norway. The analytical sample consisted of patients with illicit drug use (n\,=\,374) who took part in a follow-up interview three months after discharge from inpatient treatment (n\,=\,249) (retention rate\,=\,67\%). Data were collected using information from electronic medical records, a self-report questionnaire at treatment entry, and a follow-up interview. RESULTS: Relapse occurred among 37\% of the sample by three-month follow-up. Results of multivariable analysis showed that younger age and having a psychiatric diagnosis were associated with an elevated relapse risk. Patients who received treatment at a short-term clinic (2-4\,months), as opposed to a long-term clinic ({$>$}6\,months) were also at increased risk of relapse, regardless of their length of stay. Reduced risk of relapse was predicted by having completed the inpatient treatment stay. CONCLUSION: Identifying the treatment needs of young patients and patients with co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses during and following inpatient SUD treatment may contribute to reduced post-treatment relapse rates. Further research is needed to illuminate the treatment-related factors that contribute to reduced risk of relapse after inpatient SUD treatment.},

First, we find some significant factors for addiction by talking to doctors, drug-addicted people, and read relevant articles and write-ups. Then we collect data from both addicted and nonaddicted people. After preprocessing the data set, we apply nine conspicuous machine learning algorithms, namely k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, SVM, na{\"i}ve bayes, classification, and regression trees, random forest, multilayer perception, adaptive boosting, and gradient boosting machine on our processed data set and measure the performances of each of these classifiers in terms of some prominent performance metrics. Logistic regression is found outperforming all other classifiers in terms of all metrics used by attaining an accuracy approaching 97.91\%. On the contrary, CART shows poor results of an accuracy approaching 59.37\% after applying principal component analysis.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether phone sensor data and machine learning models are useful to detect alcohol use events, and to discuss implications of these results for just-in-time mobile interventions. METHODS: 38 non-treatment seeking young adult heavy drinkers downloaded AWARE app (which continuously collected mobile phone sensor data), and reported alcohol consumption (number of drinks, start/end time of prior day's drinking) for 28days. We tested various machine learning models using the 20 most informative sensor features to classify time periods as non-drinking, low-risk (1 to 3/4 drinks per occasion for women/men), and high-risk drinking ({$>$}4/5 drinks per occasion for women/men). RESULTS: Among 30 participants in the analyses, 207 non-drinking, 41 low-risk, and 45 high-risk drinking episodes were reported. A Random Forest model using 30-min windows with 1day of historical data performed best for detecting high-risk drinking, correctly classifying high-risk drinking windows 90.9\% of the time. The most informative sensor features were related to time (i.e., day of week, time of day), movement (e.g., change in activities), device usage (e.g., screen duration), and communication (e.g., call duration, typing speed). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence suggests that sensor data captured from mobile phones of young adults is useful in building accurate models to detect periods of high-risk drinking. Interventions using mobile phone sensor features could trigger delivery of a range of interventions to potentially improve effectiveness.},

The results of this investigation suggest that text messaging symbols are most frequently used to identify people and their relationships to other things (including other people). They also suggest that text messaging symbols are frequently used to express amusement. In addition, the results suggest that the text messaging community has developed its own language culture in which closing expressions, long-form dialog, and correct spelling and grammar are viewed as inefficient and impractical. Finally, the results suggest that text messaging symbols are often used to signal descriptions of things that are important to the message sender.},

  abstract = {Historically research has focused on the characteristics of adults who relapse following treatment for alcohol or drug dependence. The circumstances of adolescent relapse, however, have largely gone unattended. The present study investigated the relapse rates and characteristics of adolescent posttreatment drug relapse. Seventy-five teens and their parents were interviewed while participating in an adolescent chemical dependency treatment program and at three and six months following treatment. Results indicate that a number of characteristics of adolescent relapse, including rates, are comparable to those of adults. In contrast to adult relapse, adolescent relapses occur most commonly in the presence of social pressure to drink. Situational characteristics of initial relapse experiences were different for transient or minor relapses and adolescent relapses which lead to a return to abusive drinking and drug use patterns.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}bold{$>$}Background:{$<$}/bold{$>$} Digital health products designed to help people with severe mental health problems appear to be feasible, acceptable, and efficacious. The challenge facing the digital mental health field is implementing digital tools in routine service delivery. To date, there has been a paucity of qualitative research exploring staff views of digital health solutions in the context of mental healthcare. Engaging and involving frontline staff in the design and rollout of new technology to improve utilization is imperative for successful uptake and adoption of digital tools. The aim of the current study is to explore frontline staff views regarding the utility and appropriateness of using digital tools in the healthcare pathway for people accessing specialist secondary care mental health services.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$><$}bold{$>$}Method:{$<$}/bold{$>$} Qualitative study using framework analysis was used with 48 mental health staff working in early intervention for psychosis services.

Thirteen recommendations are made in this paper as a result of the themes generated in these data. Implementing of digital systems needs to be simple and uncomplicated and improve clinical workflows for staff rather than hinder and increase clinical workflows. Furthermore, organizational support with a clear plan for implementing technological innovations is required for successful adoption of digital systems. Consideration of staff views around digital systems is important if successful adoption and implementation of such systems are to occur.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Clinical Trial Registration: {$<$}uri xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"{$>$}http://www.isrctn.com{$<$}/uri{$>$}, identifier ISRCTN34966555.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The Weekly Check-in is a self-monitoring service, provided in A-CHESS, to track patients' recovery progress.

Although rates of and time to relapse appear to be similar for treated adolescents and adults, this critical review of the literature on adolescent relapse begins with an overview of developmental differences between adolescent and adult substance users that need to be considered when studying relapse. A summary of rates of relapse in treated teens is followed by a review of results on the predictive validity of different relapse definitions. Next, characteristics of teens' initial relapse in terms of substances involved, situational context, and factors associated with relapse are described. Because relapse is ideally understood in the context of longer-term patterns of use, the review also discusses the extent to which early episodes of use mark clinically significant change points in post-treatment course, and how knowledge of longer-term clinical course is essential to understanding the relapse process and mechanisms underlying the maintenance of behavioral change.},

Findings have indicated that people with higher SES may consume similar or greater amounts of alcohol compared with people with lower SES, although the latter group seems to bear a disproportionate burden of negative alcohol-related consequences. These associations are further complicated by a variety of moderating factors, such as race, ethnicity, and gender. Thus, among individuals with lower SES, members of further marginalized communities, such as racial and ethnic minorities and homeless individuals, experience greater alcohol-related consequences. Future studies are needed to more fully explore the underlying mechanisms of the relationship between SES and alcohol outcomes. This knowledge should be applied toward the development of multilevel interventions that address not only individual-level risks but also economic disparities that have precipitated and maintained a disproportionate level of alcohol-related consequences among more marginalized and vulnerable populations.},

Demographic, alcohol use, dependence severity, craving, health-related quality of life, and psychological measures at baseline were used to predict abstinence at 12 weeks. Decision trees had a 77\% predictive accuracy across both data sets, Bayesian networks 73\%, and discriminant analysis 42\%.

Thirty-four adolescents (76\% female; ages 13--17) responded to daily electronic surveys for four weeks after discharge. Survey adherence was 69\% (n\,=\,650 days) and decreased each week. Adherence was half as likely among adolescents without attempt history (OR\,=\,0.50, CI\,=\,0.27--0.95). Mid- and end-point study responses indicated high acceptability of daily diaries. Most adolescents reported no change or more positive change in their thoughts/mood after daily surveys. Suicidal ideation was reported on 24.4\% (n\,=\,159) of the days. In the month post discharge, more teens reported suicidal thoughts using daily surveys (70.6\%) compared to end-of-study assessment (45.2\%) (Chi-square\,=\,4.24, p\,=\,.039). Two participants (5.9\%) reported an attempt. Ideation frequency and duration varied across time, suggesting utility of frequent assessments in this context.

Its prevalence is expected to reach unprecedented levels as the U.S. population ages; consequently, it is poised to place a significant burden on the healthcare system. Given the growing body of evidence regarding the patterns of use in this age group and the serious consequences of its misuse, it is critical that nurses and other healthcare providers assess for AUD in order to identify older adults in need of treatment. Yet, differences in symptom presentation, problems in isolating the symptoms of AUD from other healthcare complaints associated with aging, as well as the denial and fear of stigma that is especially pervasive in this age group, are major barriers to its identification and subsequent treatment. Furthermore, the lack of consistent use of evidence-based, age-specific screening instruments to identify those at risk is another significant obstacle to successful treatment. Healthcare providers in primary care are especially well-positioned to perform a systematic assessment utilizing appropriate instruments to identify AUD and initiate age-specific interventions, including the use of alcohol screening and brief interventions (ASBIs). The use of ASBIs, along with other targeted interventions such as mutual help groups (MHGs), such as Alcoholics Anonymous, can be key in encouraging insight, dismantling denial, and supporting treatment success, lifelong recovery, and overall quality of life in this vulnerable group.},

METHODS: To examine the questionnaire's psychometric properties, we sampled responses from 147 individuals participating in a 9-month combined natrexone (100 mg/day)/psychotherapy trial. The psychotherapy consisted of weekly sessions of nurse-administered medication compliance and supportive treatment. RESULTS: The PACS proved to have excellent internal consistency. Predictive validity was demonstrated via a logistic regression analysis of craving during the 2nd week of the study on alcohol relapse during weeks 3-12 of the trial. Construct validity of the PACS was demonstrated via its convergence with two commonly used measures for assessing craving, the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale and the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire. Lack of correlation between PACS scores and several other noncraving, self-report measures indicates that the PACS also had good discriminant validity. Additional analyses revealed that there were significant differences in craving scores during the initial 3 weeks of the trial among those who did and those who did not relapse during weeks 3-12. CONCLUSION: The PACS is a reliable and valid measure of alcohol craving and can predict which individuals are at risk for subsequent relapse.},

  abstract = {Objective This paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of available evidence on remission rates for substance use disorders (SUDs), providing weighted mean estimates of SUD remission rates. The review also explores study-level characteristics that may explain variations in remission rates across studies. Methods A comprehensive search strategy identified studies published between 2000 and 2015 with follow-up periods of at least three years or reported lifetime remission outcomes for potential inclusion in the review. Remission was defined as not meeting diagnostic criteria for abuse or dependence for a minimum period of six months, as of final follow-up. A single-group summary meta-analysis was performed. Pooled estimated annual remission rates (PEARRs) were calculated. Meta-regression techniques and subgroup analyses were used to explore the association between study remission rates and key selected variables. Results Of 8855 studies identified, 21 met the eligibility criteria. The results suggested that 35.0\% to 54.4\% of individuals with SUDs achieved remission, and this occurred after a mean follow-up period of 17 years. The PEARRs projected few cases of SUD remission, between 6.8\% and 9.1\% in any given year. Studies that reported higher remission rates had longer follow-up periods, and lower sample retention rates. Conclusions Results support the contention that SUDs are more likely to be ``chronic'' or long term disorders than acute disorders for a substantial number of individuals. However, more longitudinal research is required. Treatment geared to chronicity, such as assertive community treatment and intensive case management, needs to be more readily available for SUD populations.},

We sought to quantify gender differences in alcohol service utilization, overall and by type, using national longitudinal data and to explore potential gender differences in perceived need for help and reasons for not seeking help. Methods: We analyzed data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions from White, African American, and Hispanic adults (n=2,592) who met DSM-IV criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence at Wave 1 (2000--2001). We tested gender differences in Wave 2 (2004--2005) service utilization, perceived need for help, and treatment barriers using Rao-Scott chi-square tests and assessed predictors of outcomes in multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for problem severity, co-occurring disorders, and demographics. Results: Women had much lower odds than men of utilizing any alcohol service (aOR 0.53; 95\% CI: 0.33, 0.86), specialty services (aOR 0.41; 95\% CI 0.19, 0.87), and 12-step groups (aOR 0.39; 95\% CI 0.21, 0.71). Perceived need for help among those who had not used any services was very low (5\%), with no gender difference. Further, men and women reported equivalent numbers of treatment barriers and the same rank order for the most frequently endorsed barriers. However, women were twice as likely as men to think a problem would get better by itself---the most frequent reason for not seeking help (47\% vs. 24\%, p{$<$}.001), and men were more likely than women to report unsuccessful past help-seeking and not thinking anyone could help (19\% vs. 3\%, p{$<$}.001; and 17\% vs. 5\%, p{$<$}.001, respectively). Conclusions: Consistent with previous studies, women were less likely to utilize alcohol services than men. Future interventions should address low problem recognition, and tailoring to gender-specific barriers may help close the disparity in services utilization.},

Although three pharmacotherapeutic agents have been shown to decrease heavy drinking days among individuals with AUD, they are vastly underutilized in clinical practice. The objective of this review was to elucidate barriers that may prevent patients from obtaining medication for addiction treatment (MAT) for AUD in an outpatient or residential setting.           Methods:~           Electronic searches of Medline and EMBASE were conducted, and reference lists were hand-searched. All study designs which discussed the use of MAT for AUD in an outpatient or residential setting were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently screened the search output to identify potentially eligible articles, the full texts of which were retrieved and assessed for inclusion.           Results:~           After eliminating duplicate citations and articles that did not meet eligibility criteria, 23 articles were included in the review. Perceived barriers to obtaining pharmacotherapy for the treatment of AUD in an outpatient or residential setting were grouped into 3 themes: lack of knowledge and concerns about efficacy and complexity of prescribing; treatment philosophy and stigma; medication accessibility including formulary restrictions, geographical and socioeconomic barriers.           Conclusions:~           Although evidence-based pharmacotherapeutics have been approved for the treatment of AUD, our findings suggest patients continue to experience barriers to the use of these medications. Efforts should be made to increase rates of prescribing by providers and the use of medications by patients. More research is needed to further elucidate perceived barriers to MAT use, along with strategies to overcome them.},

Prominent addiction theories emphasize the role of motivation in the alcohol seeking process, which has largely been studied using preclinical models. In order to bridge the gap between preclinical and clinical studies, this study examined predictors of motivation for alcohol self-administration using a novel paradigm. Heavy drinkers (n = 67) completed an alcohol infusion consisting of an alcohol challenge (target breath alcohol = 60 mg\%) and a progressive-ratio alcohol self-administration paradigm (maximum breath alcohol 120 mg\%; ratio requirements range = 20--3 139 response). Growth curve modeling was used to predict breath alcohol trajectories during alcohol self-administration. K-means clustering was used to identify motivated (n = 41) and unmotivated (n = 26) self-administration trajectories. The data were analyzed using two approaches: a theory-driven test of a-priori predictors and a data-driven, machine learning model. In both approaches, steeper delay discounting, indicating a preference for smaller, sooner rewards, predicted motivated alcohol seeking. The data-driven approach further identified phasic alcohol craving as a predictor of motivated alcohol self-administration. Additional application of this model to AUD translational science and treatment development appear warranted.},

  abstract = {A body of literature has demonstrated that users' mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, can be predicted from their social media language. There is still a gap in the scientific understanding of how psychological stress is expressed on social media. Stress is one of the primary underlying causes and correlates of chronic physical illnesses and mental health conditions. In this paper, we explore the language of psychological stress with a dataset of 601 social media users, who answered the Perceived Stress Scale questionnaire and also consented to share their Facebook and Twitter data. Firstly, we find that stressed users post about exhaustion, losing control, increased self-focus and physical pain as compared to posts about breakfast, family-time, and travel by users who are not stressed. Secondly, we find that Facebook language is more predictive of stress than Twitter language. Thirdly, we demonstrate how the language based models thus developed can be adapted and be scaled to measure county-level trends. Since county-level language is easily available on Twitter using the Streaming API, we explore multiple domain adaptation algorithms to adapt user-level Facebook models to Twitter language. We find that domain-adapted and scaled social media-based measurements of stress outperform sociodemographic variables (age, gender, race, education, and income), against ground-truth survey-based stress measurements, both at the user- and the county-level in the U.S. Twitter language that scores higher in stress is also predictive of poorer health, less access to facilities and lower socioeconomic status in counties. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of using social media as a new tool for monitoring stress levels of both individuals and counties.

  abstract = {Importance: Patients leaving treatment for alcohol-use disorders (AUDs) are not typically offered evidence-based continuing care, although research suggests that continuing care is associated with better outcomes. A smartphone-based application could provide effective continuing care. Objective: To determine whether patients leaving residential treatment for AUDs with a smartphone application to support recovery have fewer risky drinking days than control-group patients. Design: An un-blinded randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomized to treatment as usual or treatment as usual plus a smartphone with A-CHESS, an application designed to improve continuing care for AUDs. ``A-CHESS'' stands for Addiction -- Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System. Setting: Three residential programs operated by one treatment organization in the Midwestern US and 2 residential programs operated by one organization in the Northeastern US. Participants: 349 patients who met the criteria for DSM-IV alcohol dependence when they entered residential treatment. 179 were randomized to the control group and 170 to the treatment group. Intervention: Treatment as usual varied across programs; none offered patients coordinated continuing care after discharge. A-CHESS provides monitoring, information, communication, and support services to patients, including ways for patients and counselors to stay in contact. The intervention lasted 8 months and the follow-up period lasted 4 months. Main Outcome Measure: Risky drinking days---the number of days during which a patient's drinking in a 2-hour period exceeded, for men, 4 standard drinks and for women, 3 standard drinks. Patients were asked to report their risky drinking days in the previous 30 days on surveys taken 4, 8, and 12 months after discharge from residential treatment. Results: For the 8 months of the intervention and 4 months of follow-up, patients in the A-CHESS group reported significantly fewer risky drinking days than patients in the control group (M = 1.39 vs. 2.75, respectively; P = .003; 95\% CI [.46, 2.27]). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that a multi-featured smartphone application may have significant benefit to patients in continuing care for AUDs.

Either addicts never stop using drugs, or if they do stop, remission is short lived. However, research on remission reveals a more complex picture. In national epidemiological surveys that recruited representative drug users, remission rates varied widely and were markedly different for legal and illegal drugs and for different racial/ethnic groups. For instance, the half-life for cocaine dependence was four years, but for alcohol dependence it was 16 years, and although most dependent cocaine users remitted before age 30, about 5\% remained heavy cocaine users well into their forties. Although varied, the remission results were orderly. An exponential growth curve closely approximated the cumulative frequency of remitting for different drugs and different ethnic/racial groups. Thus, each year a constant proportion of those still addicted remitted, independent of the number of years since the onset of dependence.},

Clinical ratings were performed three times a week by a trained person during a visit to the clinic. The questionnaire contained 23 different items about irritation, craving for alcohol. sleep disturbances, etc. The relapses were either self-reported or detected by a biochemical marker in a urine sample that was taken daily. The most important factor for a relapse in alcohol drinking was shown to be if the patient already had had one relapse during the treatment. Other important clinical factors were the levels of irritation and autonomic disturbances. None of the variables measuring mood shifts was significant. Family conditions during childhood were the most important background variables. The predictions turned out to have a rather high specificity, but the sensitivity was lower. Half of the relapses were not predicted by an increased probability for relapse. Self-reported relapses were predictable from preceding interviews and were also less frequent compared to those detected objectively by the biochemical markers.},

The author strongly concurs in the need for statistics reform. This paper offers a practitioner's perspective on statistics reform. In the author's view, some statistical methods are good and should withstand statistics reform; some are bad and should be abandoned and removed from statistics textbooks and computer software packages. This paper focuses on two statistical methods derived from the t-distribution: the two-sample t-test and the t-interval method for measurement uncertainty calculation. We show why these two methods should be abandoned. We recommend using descriptive statistic analysis as an alternative to the two-sample t-test and an unbiased estimation method as an alternative to the t-interval method for measurement uncertainty calculation. Two examples are provided to demonstrate the recommended alternatives.},

To date, most studies have taken a linear approach toward predicting relapse based on risk factors. Nonlinear dynamical systems theory can be used to describe processes that are not adequately modeled using a linear approach. In particular, the authors propose that catastrophe theory, a subset of nonlinear dynamical systems theory, can be used to describe the relapse process in addictive behaviors. Two small prospective studies using 6-month follow-ups of patients with alcohol use disorders (inpatient, n=51; outpatient, n=43) illustrate how cusp catastrophe theory may be used to predict relapse. Results from these preliminary studies indicate that a cusp catastrophe model has more predictive utility than traditional linear models.

A smartphone application, iHOPE, was used to perform daily EMA of depression, anxiety, sleep and cognitive performance. Outpatients with depressive disorder were recruited to use iHOPE for 8 weeks. Clinical characteristics and smartphone use patterns were assessed at baseline. We enrolled 59 Chinese patients with depression. In 8 weeks, participants interacted with iHOPE for an average of 10.8 (SD=12.3) days; a trend of decreased frequency of use (p=0.03) was observed. Scores of HAM-D at baseline was associated with, of the first 2 weeks, scores of PHQ-9 (p=0.005), EMA of depression (p=0.003) and anxiety (p{$<$}0.001), and poorer sleep quality (p=0.023). Among the demographic, clinical and smartphone-use variables examined, only limited internet package for smartphone ({$<$}500M per month) predicted higher use of iHOPE (p=0.04).

The present paper aims to further extend this model to incorporate social variables more fully. Methods The social-factors and alcohol-relapse literatures were reviewed within the framework of the reformulated relapse model. Results The literature review found that the number of social network members, investment of the individual in the social network, levels of general and alcohol-specific support available within the social network, and specific behaviors of network members all predict drinking outcomes. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which these social variables influence outcomes. The authors postulate that social variables influence outcomes by affecting intraindividual factors central to the reformulated relapse prevention model, including processes (e.g. self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, craving, motivation, negative affective states) and behaviors (e.g. coping and substance use. The authors suggest specific hypotheses and discuss methods that can be used to study the impact of social factors on the intraindividual phenomena that contribute to relapse.

  abstract = {Objectives. To assess racial and ethnic differences in rates of completion from publicly funded alcohol treatment programs, and to estimate the extent to which any identified racial differences in completion rates are related to differences in patient characteristics. Data Sources. Administrative intake and discharge records from all publicly funded outpatient and residential alcohol treatment recovery programs in Los Angeles County (LAC) during 1998--2000. Study participants (N=10,591) are African American, Hispanic, and white patients discharged from these programs, ages 18 or older, who reported alcohol as their primary substance abuse problem. Study Design. Bivariate tests identified racial and ethnic differences in rates of treatment completion and patient characteristics. Logistic regression models assessed the contribution of differences in patient characteristics to differences in completion. Principal Findings. Significantly lower completion rates by African Americans (17.5 percent) relative to whites (26.7 percent) (odds ratio [OR]=0.58, 95 percent confidence interval [CI]: 0.50--0.68) are partially explained (40 percent) by differences in patient characteristics in outpatient care (adjusted OR=0.75, 95 percent CI: 0.63--0.90), mostly by indicators of economic resources (i.e., employment, homelessness, and Medi-Cal beneficiary). In residential care, only 7 percent of differences in completion (30.7 versus 46.1 percent) could be explained by the patient-level measures available (OR=0.52, 95 percent CI: 0.45--0.59; AOR=0.55, 95 percent CI: 0.47--0.65). Differences in completion rates between Hispanic and white patients were not detected. Conclusions. Large differences in rates of outpatient and residential alcohol treatment completion between African American and white patients at publicly funded programs in LAC, the nation's second largest, publicly funded alcohol and drug treatment system, are partially because of economic differences among patients, but remain largely unexplained. These racial disparities merit additional investigation and the attention of health professionals.},

Nevertheless, most persons with mental health or substance use disorders do not receive care.

  abstract = {Objectives: Longer retention in treatment is associated with positive outcomes. For women, who suffer worse drug-related problems than men, social technologies, which are more readily adopted by women, may offer promise. This naturalistic study examined whether a smartphone-based relapse-prevention system, A-CHESS (Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System), could improve retention for women with substance use disorders in an impoverished rural setting. Methods: A total of 98 women, age 18 to 40, in southeastern Kentucky and mandated to treatment, received A-CHESS with intensive outpatient treatment for 6\,months. For comparison, data were obtained for a similar but non-equivalent group of 100 same-age women also mandated to treatment in the same clinics during the period. Electronic medical record data on length-of-stay and treatment service use for both groups were analyzed, with A-CHESS use data, to determine whether those using A-CHESS showed better retention than those without. Results: Women with A-CHESS averaged 780 service units compared with 343 for the comparison group. For those with discharge dates prior to the study's end, A-CHESS patients stayed in treatment a mean of 410 vs 262\,days for the comparison group. Conclusions: Given associations between retention and positive outcomes, mobile health technology such as A-CHESS may help improve outcomes among women, especially in settings where access to in-person services is difficult. The findings, based on a non-equivalent comparison, suggest the need for further exploration with rigorous experimental designs to determine whether and to what degree access to a smartphone with A-CHESS may extend and support recovery for women.},

Neither the reliability of the original Marlatt coding system nor its predictive or construct validity was supported by this group of studies. The present commentary explores a number of possible reasons for the generally negative outcomes. These findings should certainly lead to a re-evaluation of Marlatt's relapse taxonomy and its operationalization. Nevertheless, despite the negative results, there are a number of reasons why the general Relapse Prevention concept is likely to survive in some form: it has been widely adopted and imitated clinically, key elements of the taxonomy are often focal points of treatment, and clinical research studies have repeatedly supported some elements of the taxonomy (e.g. negative emotional states, social pressure, interpersonal conflict, positive emotional states and temptations/urges). The RREP also evaluated some modifications of the original taxonomy as well as the use of more structured assessment instruments, and some of these provided more promising results. Further developments will need to take into account both research needs for greater precision, most likely through the use of more structured assessment instruments, and clinical needs for richness of detail and sensitivity to a wide variety of life circumstances.},

Our sample (N\,=\,1376) included individuals of European (EA) and African (AA) ancestry from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) who were initially assessed as having AUD (DSM-5) and reassessed years later as either having AUD or in remission. To predict this difference in AUD recovery status, we analyzed the initial data using multimodal, multi-features machine learning applications including EEG source-level functional brain connectivity, Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS), medications, and demographic information. Sex and ancestry age-matched stratified analyses were performed with supervised linear Support Vector Machine application and were calculated twice, once when the ancestry was defined by self-report and once defined by genetic data. Multifeatured prediction models achieved higher accuracy scores than models based on a single domain and higher scores in male models when the ancestry was based on genetic data. The AA male group model with PRS, EEG functional connectivity, marital and employment status features achieved the highest accuracy of 86.04\%. Several discriminative features were identified, including collections of PRS related to neuroticism, depression, aggression, years of education, and alcohol consumption phenotypes. Other discriminated features included being married, employed, medication, lower default mode network and fusiform connectivity, and higher insula connectivity. Results highlight the importance of increasing genetic homogeneity of analyzed groups, identifying sex, and ancestry-specific features to increase prediction scores revealing biomarkers related to AUD remission.},

In fact, there is an exponential increase in the number of mental health apps available on the internet, with less than 5\% being actually studied. Objective: This study aimed to assess the quality of the available evidence regarding the use of mental health apps and to summarize the results obtained so far. Methods: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were searched, specifically for mobile apps on mental health issues or symptoms, and rated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. Results: A total of 7 meta-analyses were carefully reviewed and rated. Although some meta-analyses looked at any mental health issue and analyzed the data together, these studies were of poorer quality and did not offer strong empirical support for the apps. Studies focusing specifically on anxiety symptoms or depressive symptoms were of moderate to high quality and generally had small to medium effect sizes. Similarly, the effects of apps on stress and quality of life tended to offer small to medium effects and were of moderate to high quality. Studies looking at stand-alone apps had smaller effect sizes but better empirical quality than studies looking at apps with guidance. The studies that included follow-ups mostly found a sustained impact of the app at an 11-week follow-up. Conclusions: This meta-review revealed that apps for anxiety and depression hold great promise with clear clinical advantages, either as stand-alone self-management or as adjunctive treatments. More meta-analyses and more quality studies are needed to recommend apps for other mental health issues or for specific populations.},

This report highlights the number of American adults with SUDs in the past year and trends in SUDs between 2002 and 2014.~Method:~This report uses data from the 2002 to 2014 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health to examine trends in SUDs and receipt of treatment for substance use between 2002 and 2014.~Results:~Approximately 20.2 million adults aged 18 or older had a past year SUD. Of these adults, 16.3 million had an alcohol use disorder and 6.2 million had an illicit drug use disorder. An estimated 2.3 million adults had both an alcohol use disorder and an illicit drug use disorder in the past year. Of the adults with a past year SUD, 4 out of 5 had an alcohol use disorder, nearly 3 out of 10 had an illicit drug use disorder, and 1 out of 9 had both an alcohol use disorder and an illicit drug use disorder. The percentage of adults with a past year SUD in 2014 was similar to the percentages in 2010 to 2013 but was lower than the percentages in 2002 to 2009. Conclusion:~Monitoring trends in SUDs gives public health providers opportunities to assess the scope of the issue in the United States and to plan substance abuse prevention and treatment programming. Most SUDs in the United States are related to alcohol use, and the long-term trends indicate that there has been a decrease in the prevalence of past year alcohol use disorders among adults. Although illicit drug use disorders are less prevalent than alcohol use disorders among adults, the long-term trends in this report indicate that there has not been a reduction in the percentage of adults who had an illicit drug use disorder in the past year.},

  abstract = {Background Personal sensing has shown promise for detecting behavioral correlates of depression, but there is little work examining personal sensing of cognitive and affective states. Digital language, particularly through personal text messages, is one source that can measure these markers. Methods We correlated privacy-preserving sentiment analysis of text messages with self-reported depression symptom severity. We enrolled 219~U.S. adults in a 16 week longitudinal observational study. Participants installed a personal sensing app on their phones, which administered self-report PHQ-8 assessments of their depression severity, collected phone sensor data, and computed anonymized language sentiment scores from their text messages. We also trained machine learning models for predicting end-of-study self-reported depression status using on blocks of phone sensor and text features. Results In correlation analyses, we find that degrees of depression, emotional, and personal pronoun language categories correlate most strongly with self-reported depression, validating prior literature. Our classification models which predict binary depression status achieve a leave-one-out AUC of 0.72 when only considering text features and 0.76 when combining text with other networked smartphone sensors. Limitations Participants were recruited from a panel that over-represented women, caucasians, and individuals with self-reported depression at baseline. As language use differs across demographic factors, generalizability beyond this population may be limited. The study period also coincided with the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, which may have affected smartphone sensor data quality. Conclusions Effective depression prediction through text message sentiment, especially when combined with other personal sensors, could enable comprehensive mental health monitoring and intervention.},

  abstract = {The Relapse Replication and Extension Project (RREP) was a multisite study to replicate and extend Marlatt's taxonomy of relapse precipitants. In addition to replicating Marlatt's original taxonomic system, three independent research teams utilized prospective designs to identify additional predictors of relapse and developed and evaluated two alternative systems for assessing high risk relapse situations. This overview describes the replication methodology, summarizes seven RREP studies completed by the three research groups, and discusses five cross-cutting conclusions emerging from the studies. These conclusions are: (1) reliability of Marlatt's taxonomic system was variable both within and across the three research sites; (2) Marlatt's taxonomic system showed little predictive validity in analyses that used pretreatment relapse data to predict post-treatment relapse, but there are important unresolved issues; (3) an alternative taxonomy provided little more predictive validity than the original taxonomy even though it measured more dimensions of relapse},

  abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

  abstract = {Aims To test the acceptability and feasibility of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of mood and injection risk behavior among young people who inject drugs (PWID), using mobile phones. Methods Participants were 185 PWID age 18--35 recruited from two sites of a large syringe service program in Chicago. After completing a baseline interview, participants used a mobile phone app to respond to momentary surveys on mood, substance use, and injection risk behavior for 15\,days. Participants were assigned to receive surveys 4, 5, or 6 times per day. Results Participants were 68\% male, 61\% non-Hispanic white, 24\% Hispanic, and 5\% non-Hispanic Black. Out of 185 participants, 8\% (n\,=\,15) failed to complete any EMA assessments. Among 170 EMA responders, the mean number of days reporting was 10 (SD 4.7), the mean proportion of assessments completed was 0.43 (SD 0.27), and 76\% (n\,=\,130) completed the follow-up interview. In analyses adjusted for age and race/ethnicity, women were more responsive than men to the EMA surveys in days reporting (IRR\,=\,1.33, 95\% CI 1.13--1.56), and total number of surveys completed (IRR\,=\,1.51, 95\% CI 1.18--1.93). Homeless participants responded on fewer days (IRR\,=\,0.76, 95\% CI 0.64--0.90) and completed fewer surveys (IRR\,=\,0.70, 95\% CI 0.54--0.91), and were less likely to return for follow-up (p\,=\,0.016). EMA responsiveness was not significantly affected by the number of assigned daily assessments. Conclusions This study demonstrated high acceptability and feasibility of EMA among young PWID, with up to 6 survey prompts per day. However, homelessness significantly hampered successful participation.},

  abstract = {In the two decades since the first edition of this book was published in 1985, much has happened in the relapse prevention (RP) field. Many of these new developments and areas of application are described in this new edition. This new edition differs from the original 1985 volume in several important ways. The first edition consisted of two main sections: Part I, which provided a general theoretical overview of the RP model and Part II, which contained four chapters describing application of RP with specific target behaviors (alcoholism, problem drinking, smoking, and weight management). The current edition contains chapters that extend the coverage of this approach to other addictive behaviors. Although abstinence is often the preferred goal for many substance use problems (e.g., quitting smoking), moderation is required for eating behavior and may be an alternative goal for other problems (e.g., moderate drinking or gambling). In the current text, RP methods are described for client goals that include both abstinence and harm reduction. The most important change for readers to note is that this new edition of the RP book is designed to be used in conjunction with the second edition of our companion volume, Assessment of Addictive Behaviors (Donovan \& Marlatt, 2005). The same authors were invited to provide both the assessment and RP chapters, so as to enhance congruence of coverage and cross-referenced materials.

Theoretical foundations underlying the development of the taxonomy are then discussed with an emphasis on social-learning theory and its implications for cognitive-behavioral interventions for relapse prevention. Findings supporting the efficacy of coping-skills training for high-risk relapse situations, based on a prospective treatment outcome study for inpatient alcoholics, are also presented in support of the clinical validity of the relapse model.

Little is known, however, about specific factors that may influence the use of these technologies among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations with SUDs. This study characterized the use of digital technologies and the Internet among individuals receiving treatment for opioid use disorder, focusing on identifying predictors of Internet use for health-related purposes. Participants came from an urban opioid replacement therapy program and completed a face-to-face survey on Internet and technology use. We examined the association between online health information seeking and technology acceptance variables, including perceived usefulness, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions (e.g., availability of devices/services and technical support). Participants (N\,=\,178, ages 18--64) endorsed high rates of current smartphone ownership (94\%) and everyday Internet use (67\%). 88\% of participants reported searching online for information about health or medical topics in the past 3\,months. Predictors of Internet use for health-related purposes were higher technology acceptance for mobile Internet use, younger age, current employment, and less bodily pain. Our results demonstrate high acceptance and use of mobile technology and the Internet among this sample of socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals with SUDs. However, these findings also highlight the importance of identifying barriers that disadvantaged groups face in using mobile technologies when designing technology-based interventions for this population.},

Often, the first study showed a statistically significant result but the replication does not. Questions then arise about whether the first study results were false positives, and whether the replication study correctly indicates that there is truly no effect after all. This article suggests these so-called failures to replicate may not be failures at all, but rather are the result of low statistical power in single replication studies, and the result of failure to appreciate the need for multiple replications in order to have enough power to identify true effects. We provide examples of these power problems and suggest some solutions using Bayesian statistics and meta-analysis. Although the need for multiple replication studies may frustrate those who would prefer quick answers to psychology's alleged crisis, the large sample sizes typically needed to provide firm evidence will almost always require concerted efforts from multiple investigators. As a result, it remains to be seen how many of the recently claimed failures to replicate will be supported or instead may turn out to be artifacts of inadequate sample sizes and single study replications.

Material and methods: PubMed, Scopus and PsycINFO databases were searched for relevant publications the 27 th of February 2018. 492 articles where initially identified, of which 16 were eligible for inclusion in our analysis. The study quality was assessed using the Critical Appraised Skills program (CASP) checklist for qualitative studies, and the Checklist for systematics reviews (CFR) for quantitative studies. Results and discussion: This systematic review has investigated and identified barriers to treatment that vary greatly according to personal, cultural, institutional, ethnic and gender-specific factors. Three barriers proved to be prominent: Shame and stigma, lack of perception of treatment need and the paradox of both need for and fear of giving up drinking. Conclusion: A recommendation is to include in-depth questions about barriers in large national surveys. Additionally, to apple special considerations with regards to the aforementioned specific factors, when developing and offering treatment to subgroups with AUD.},

Current technology provides various mechanisms for communication, eg, through voice or text, however, participant familiarity and preference for them is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to understand participants' communication preferences, their comfort with and use of messaging methods and their attitudes towards different communication and technology-driven symptom reporting methods in clinical trials. Participants and Methods Fifty-five participants, with any form of chronic health condition or recent intervention causing daily pain or discomfort were recruited by way of convenience sample for a single-centre, non-interventional, single-visit study, conducted in Ireland. Participants completed a questionnaire on communications preferences via an app on the participants' own electronic device. Results In communication with friends and family, 69.6\% of participants most preferred to use a messaging service. In communication with their healthcare provider, 72.7\% preferred phone calls. Respondents preferred to communicate with friends/family via text messages (80.4\%) over other methods. In clinical trial settings, participants are willing to use messaging methods to communicate with their physician. When reporting symptoms, most preferred a phone/video call to physicians (50.9\%) and touch screen on device/smartphone (47.3\%). 72.7\% preferred to report symptoms using their own phone. Some respondents were interested in having the device read the questions/answers aloud (36.4\%) and answer questions verbally (41.8\%). Conclusion Participants were familiar with various communication methods but showed different preferences to communicate with friends and family versus healthcare professionals. For reporting symptoms in a clinical trial while at home, split results suggested a preference for independent reporting as well as live communication with physician, perhaps reflecting the rising use of telehealth. Further exploration is needed for the use of questions read aloud or answered verbally when reporting symptoms in a clinical trial.},

The review notes the continued move in relapse research from a primary reliance on retrospective assessment of factors surrounding the onset of relapse episodes to an increased focus on the use of new technologies to obtain "near real time" data on proximal factors in relapses. Recent advances in neurobiology have yielded important gains in our understanding of vulnerability to relapse in alcohol and other drug abusers. New statistical techniques are also available to analyze data on relapse. From a theoretical standpoint, there has been an increasing appreciation for the complicated and dynamic interplay of distal and proximal factors in the relapse process. At this point, the strongest and most detailed data on factors in the onset and course of relapse have been generated by studies of smoking relapses that have made use of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) technology. However, there is still limited "near real" time data on proximal factors in alcohol and other drug relapses, and no such data on factors that influence the course of these relapses, once they have begun. Nevertheless, important methodological advances have been and continue to be made in the study of relapse, and our knowledge about the nature and process of relapse has increased considerably over the past 10 years.},

This study tested whether supplementing intensive outpatient programs (IOPs) with continuing care delivered via (1) telephone, (2) smartphone or (3) their combination improves outcomes relative to (4) IOP only. Continuing care conditions were also compared. Design Randomized controlled trial of four groups with 3-, 6-, 9-, 12- and 18-month follow-ups. Setting University research center in Philadelphia, PA, USA. Participants Participants (n = 262) met DSM-V criteria for AUD, were largely male (71\%) and African American (82\%). Interventions and Comparator Telephone monitoring and counseling (TMC; n = 59), addiction comprehensive health enhancement support system (ACHESS; n = 68) and TMC + ACHESS (n = 70) provided for 12 months. The control condition received IOP only (TAU; n = 65). Measurement The primary outcome was percentage of days heavy drinking (PDHD) in months 1--12. Secondary outcomes were any drinking, any drug use, drinking consequences and quality of life. Findings Mean PDHD in months 1--12 was 10.29 in TAU, 5.41 in TMC, 6.80 in ACHESS and 5.99 in TMC + ACHESS. PDHD was lower in TMC [Cohen's d = 0.35, P = 0.018, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = (-1.42, -0.20)], ACHESS [d = 0.31, P = 0.031, 95\% CI = (-1.27, -0.06)] and TMC + ACHESS [d = 0.36, P = 0.009, 95\% CI = (-1.40, -0.20)] than in TAU. Differences between TMC + ACHESS, TMC and ACHESS were small (d {$\leq$} 0.06) and non-significant. Findings were inconclusive as to whether or not the treatment conditions differed on PDHD at 18 months. A significant effect was obtained on any drinking, which was higher in months 1--12 in TAU than in TMC [odds ratio (OR) = 3.02, standard error (SE) = 0.43, 95\% CI = (1.30, 6.99), P = 0.01] and TMC + ACHESS [OR = 2.43, SE = 0.39, 95\% CI = (1.12, 5.27), P = 0.025). No other significant effects were obtained on other secondary outcomes during or after treatment. Conclusions A telephone-delivered intervention and a smartphone-delivered intervention, alone and in combination, provided effective remote continuing care for alcohol use disorder. The combination of both interventions was not superior to either alone and effects did not persist post-treatment.},

Method: Representative studies that have used retrospective, prospective, or near real time methodologies to study antecedents or consequences of relapse are presented and the strengths and weaknesses of each methodology are reviewed. Limitations in the ability of substance abusers to accurately report internal states are considered. Degree of convergence in findings across methodologies is examined. Results: Retrospective reports can provide perhaps the most detailed accounts of circumstances and experiences leading up to relapse, but are also more likely to be inaccurate due to the limitations of memory. Prospective studies are less likely to be affected by memory problems, but may not capture factors that immediately precede relapse. The near real time methodology, which uses palm-top computers to gather data, has many advantages over other methodologies, but a number of limitations as well. The two studies in which retrospective reports were directly compared to either prospective or near real time reports yielded mixed results regarding degree of agreement. Findings from several areas of research suggest that some substance abusers may have difficulty recognizing and reporting internal states. Conclusions: Despite memory problems and other limitations of self-report, all three methodologies have produced findings that implicate negative affect states, increased craving, cognitive factors, interpersonal problems, and lack of coping as factors in relapse. Future relapse studies should make use of all three methodologies to obtain data on relapse and consequences, and steps should be taken to enhance the accuracy of the self-reports that are gathered with each method.}

  abstract = {The effects of drug dependence on social systems has helped shape the generally held view that drug dependence is primarily a social problem, not a health problem. In turn, medical approaches to prevention and treatment are lacking. We examined evidence that drug (including alcohol) dependence is a chronic medical illness. A literature review compared the diagnoses, heritability, etiology (genetic and environmental factors), pathophysiology, and response to treatments (adherence and relapse) of drug dependence vs type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma. Genetic heritability, personal choice, and environmental factors are comparably involved in the etiology and course of all of these disorders. Drug dependence produces significant and lasting changes in brain chemistry and function. Effective medications are available for treating nicotine, alcohol, and opiate dependence but not stimulant or marijuana dependence.

Review results suggest that long-term care strategies of medication management and continued monitoring produce lasting benefits.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Following in the footsteps of several prior attempts, this review seeks a meaningful and data-based answer to the common question of how people fare, on average, after being treated for alcoholism (broadly defined as alcohol use disorders). METHOD: Findings from seven large multisite studies were combined to derive estimates of the average effectiveness of alcoholism treatment. To provide common outcome measures, conversion equations were used to compute variables not reported in the original studies. RESULTS: During the year after treatment, 1 in 4 clients remained continuously abstinent on average, and an additional 1 in 10 used alcohol moderately and without problems. During this period, mortality averaged less than 2\%. The remaining clients, as a group, showed substantial improvement, abstaining on 3 days out of 4 and reducing their overall alcohol consumption by 87\%, on average. Alcohol-related problems also decreased by 60\%. CONCLUSIONS: About one third of clients remain asymptomatic during the year following a single treatment event. The remaining two thirds show, on average, large and significant decreases in drinking and related problems. This substantial level of improvement in "unremitted" clients tends to be overlooked when outcomes are dichotomized as successful or relapsed.},

  abstract = {Binary thinking has often guided research and practice in the addiction field. For example, emphasis has been given to identifying whether an individual is 'alcoholic' or not, and the dichotomous judgement that a client is either drinking or abstinent has been used to judge treatment effectiveness. Research on the nature of alcohol problems, however, indicates that they lie along several modestly interrelated continuous dimensions of severity, rather than occurring as a single syndrome qualitatively distinct from normality. Similarly, changes in addictive behaviors in general, and treatment outcomes in particular, are complex phenomena not readily captured by dichotomous classification. The term 'relapse' is itself seriously problematic in various ways, and its definition elusive. It represents a somewhat arbitrary binary judgement imposed on the flow of behavior, and carries negative evaluative overtones. A potentially detrimental abstinence violation effect is implicit in the very use of the term 'relapse', which thereby may become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Further, it implicitly pathologizes what is in fact a rather common event in the course of behavior change, and embodies an unrealistic and inaccurate conception of how successful change occurs over time. For these reasons, it may be useful in research and clinical practice to abandon the notion of 'relapse' and focus instead on terminology that better describes the normal resolution process for addictive behaviors.},

This study investigates the impact of SBDH, identified from both structured and unstructured data utilizing a natural language processing (NLP) system, on suicide prediction within 7, 30, 90, and 180 days of discharge. Using EHR data of 2,987,006 Veterans between October 1, 2009, and September 30, 2015, from the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA), we designed a case-control study that demonstrates that incorporating structured and NLP-extracted SBDH significantly enhances the performance of three architecturally distinct suicide predictive models - elastic-net logistic regression, random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron. For example, RF achieved notable improvements in suicide prediction within 180 days of discharge, with an increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 83.57\&amp;ndash;84.25\% (95\% CI\&amp;thinsp;=\&amp;thinsp;0.63\%-0.98\%, p-val\&amp;thinsp;\&amp;lt;\&amp;thinsp;0.001) and the area under the precision recall curve from 57.38\&amp;ndash;59.87\% (95\% CI\&amp;thinsp;=\&amp;thinsp;3.86\%-4.82\%, p-val\&amp;thinsp;\&amp;lt;\&amp;thinsp;0.001) after integrating NLP-extracted SBDH. These findings underscore the potential of NLP-extracted SBDH in enhancing suicide prediction across various prediction timeframes, offering valuable insights for healthcare practitioners and policymakers.},

Patients are commonly screened for AUD in primary care, but existing treatment programs are failing to meet demand. Digital therapeutics include novel mobile app-based treatment approaches which may be cost-effective treatment options to help fill treatment gaps. The goal of this study was to identify implementation needs and workflow design considerations for integrating digital therapeutics for AUD into primary care. Methods: We conducted qualitative interviews with clinicians, care delivery leaders, and implementation staff (n = 16) in an integrated healthcare delivery system in the United States. All participants had experience implementing digital therapeutics for depression or substance use disorders in primary care. Interviews were designed to gain insights into adaptations needed to optimize existing clinical processes, workflows, and implementation strategies for use with alcohol-focused digital therapeutics. Interviews were recorded and transcribed and then analyzed using a rapid analysis process and affinity diagramming. Results: Qualitative themes were well represented across health system staff roles. Participants were enthusiastic about digital therapeutics for AUD, anticipated high patient demand for such a resource, and made suggestions for successful implementation. Key insights regarding the implementation of digital therapeutics for AUD and unhealthy alcohol use from our data include: (1) implementation strategy selection must be driven by digital therapeutic design and target population characteristics, (2) implementation strategies should seek to minimize burden on clinicians given the large numbers of patients with AUD who are likely to be interested in and eligible for digital therapeutics, and (3) digital therapeutics should be offered alongside many other treatment options to accommodate individual patients' AUD severity and treatment goals. Participants also expressed confidence that previous implementation strategies used with other digital therapeutics such as clinician training, electronic health record supports, health coaching, and practice facilitation would be effective for the implementation of digital therapeutics for AUD. Conclusions: The implementation of digital therapeutics for AUD would benefit from careful consideration of the target population. Optimal integration requires tailoring workflows to meet anticipated patient volume and designing workflow and implementation strategies to meet the unique needs of patients with varying AUD severity.

We enumerate the challenges in emotion annotation in a crowdsourcing scenario and propose solutions to address them. Most notably, in addition to questions about emotions associated with terms, we show how the inclusion of a word choice question can discourage malicious data entry, help identify instances where the annotator may not be familiar with the target term (allowing us to reject such annotations), and help obtain annotations at sense level (rather than at word level). We conducted experiments on how to formulate the emotion-annotation questions, and show that asking if a term is associated with an emotion leads to markedly higher inter-annotator agreement than that obtained by asking if a term evokes an emotion.},

Available treatments often fail to support long-term recovery by failing to account for the dynamic nature of long-term recovery. Objective: The aim of this protocol paper is to describe research that aims to develop a highly contextualized lapse risk prediction model that forecasts the ongoing probability of lapse. Methods: The participants will include 480 US adults in their first year of recovery from OUD. Participants will report lapses and provide data relevant to lapse risk for a year with a digital therapeutic smartphone app through both self-report and passive personal sensing methods (eg, cellular communications and geolocation). The lapse risk prediction model will be developed using contemporary rigorous machine learning methods that optimize prediction in new data. Results: The National Institute of Drug Abuse funded this project (R01DA047315) on July 18, 2019 with a funding period from August 1, 2019 to June 30, 2024. The University of Wisconsin-Madison Health Sciences Institutional Review Board approved this project on July 9, 2019. Pilot enrollment began on April 16, 2021. Full enrollment began in September 2021. Conclusions: The model that will be developed in this project could support long-term recovery from OUD---for example, by enabling just-in-time interventions within digital therapeutics.},

There is a critical need to identify modifiable risk factors associated with relapse that can be addressed during AUD treatment. Candidate factors include mood disorders and cigarette smoking, which frequently co-occur with AUD. We predicted that co-occurrence of mood disorders, cigarette smoking, and other modifiable conditions will predict relapse within six months of AUD treatment. Ninety-five Veterans, 23--91 years old, completed assessments of multiple characteristics including demographic information, co-occurring psychiatric disorders, and medical conditions during residential treatment for AUD. Participants' alcohol consumption was monitored over six months after participation. Logistic regression was used to determine if, mood disorders, cigarette smoking status, alcohol consumption, educational level, and comorbid general medical conditions are associated with relapse after AUD treatment. Sixty-nine percent of Veterans (n = 66) relapsed within six months of study while 31\% remained abstinent (n = 29). While education, comorbid general medical conditions, and mood disorder diagnoses were not predictors of relapse, Veterans with greater symptoms of anhedonia, active smokers, and fewer days of abstinence prior to treatment showed significantly greater odds for relapse within six months. Anhedonia and cigarette smoking are modifiable risk factors, and effective treatment of underlying anhedonic symptoms and implementation of smoking cessation concurrent with AUD-focused interventions may decrease risk of relapse.},

Methods Data from 2015 to 2020 from 16,987 young adults (ages 19--30) and 23,584 middle adults (ages 35--55) in the national Monitoring the Future study were used to model historical trends and potential 2020 shifts (data collection April 1 to November 30, 2020) in prevalence (30-day, daily, binge drinking) and frequency (30-day, binge drinking). For young adults, data on drinking contexts and negative affect reasons for drinking were examined. Moderation by age and college status was also tested. Results 2020 was associated with (1) downward deviation in 30-day (young and middle adults) and binge drinking (young adults) prevalence; (2) upward deviation in daily drinking prevalence (middle adults); (3) among drinkers, upward deviation in frequency of 30-day (young and middle adults) and binge drinking (young adults); and (4) changes in drinking contexts and reasons among drinkers. Among college students, in particular, 2020 was associated with a downward deviation from expected historical trends in drinking prevalence. Upward deviations in daily prevalence and both binge and 30-day drinking frequency were stronger at ages 25--30 (vs. 19--24) and 35--45 (vs. 50--55). Conclusions Among U.S. young and middle adults, deviations from expected historical trends in population alcohol use that occurred during the pandemic included decreases in alcohol use prevalence, increases in alcohol use frequency, and increases in the use of alcohol to relax/relieve tension and because of boredom. These shifts were likely due, in part, to drinking while alone and at home---which increased during the pandemic.},

Available frameworks have not clearly articulated why and how researchers, practitioners and policy makers may wish to study the concept of acceptability. Here, we aim to discuss (i) the ways in which acceptability might differ from closely related concepts, including user engagement; (ii) the utility of the concept of acceptability in digital health research and practice; (iii) social and cultural norms that influence acceptability; and (iv) pragmatic means of measuring acceptability, within and beyond the research process. Our intention is not to offer solutions to these open questions but to initiate a debate within the digital health community. We conducted a narrative review of theoretical and empirical examples from the literature. First, we argue that acceptability may usefully be considered an emergent property of a complex, adaptive system of interacting components (e.g., affective attitude, beliefs), which in turn influences (and is influenced by) user engagement. Second, acceptability is important due to its ability to predict and explain key outcomes of interest, including user engagement and intervention effectiveness. Third, precisely what people find acceptable is deeply contextualized and interlinked with prevailing social and cultural norms. Understanding and designing for such norms (e.g., through drawing on principles of user centered design) is therefore key. Finally, there is a lack of standard acceptability measures and thresholds. Star ratings coupled with free-text responses may provide a pragmatic means of capturing acceptability. Acceptability is a multifaceted concept, which may usefully be studied with a complexity science lens.},

  abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted mental health care delivery to digital platforms, videoconferencing, and other mobile communications. However, existing reviews of digital health interventions are narrow in scope and focus on a limited number of~mental health conditions. Objective: To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive systematic meta-review of the literature to assess the state of digital health interventions for the treatment of mental health conditions. Methods: We searched MEDLINE for secondary literature published between 2010 and 2021 on the use, efficacy, and appropriateness of digital health interventions for the delivery of mental health care. Results: Of the 3022 records identified, 466 proceeded to full-text review and 304 met the criteria for inclusion in this study. A majority (52\%) of research involved the treatment of substance use disorders, 29\% focused on mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders, and \&gt;5\% for each remaining mental health conditions. Synchronous and asynchronous communication, computerized therapy, and cognitive training appear to be effective but require further examination in understudied mental health conditions. Similarly, virtual reality, mobile apps, social media platforms, and web-based forums are novel technologies that have the potential to improve mental health but require higher quality evidence. Conclusions: Digital health interventions offer promise in the treatment of mental health conditions. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital health interventions provide a safer alternative to face-to-face treatment. However, further research on the applications of digital interventions in understudied mental health conditions is needed. Additionally, evidence is needed on the effectiveness and appropriateness of digital health tools for patients who are marginalized and may lack access to digital health interventions.},

  abstract = {Background Smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a promising methodology for mental health research. The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of smartphone-based active and passive EMA in psychiatric outpatients and student controls. Methods Two smartphone applications ---MEmind and eB2--- were developed for behavioral active and passive monitoring. The applications were tested in psychiatric patients with a history of suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors (STB), psychiatric patients without a history of STB, and student controls. Main outcome was feasibility, measured as response to recruitment, retention, and EMA compliance. Secondary outcomes were patterns of smartphone usage. Results Response rate was 87.3\% in patients with a history of STB, 85.1\% in patients without a history of STB, and 75.0\% in student controls. 457 participants installed the MEmind app (120 patients with a history of STB and 337 controls) and 1,708 installed the eB2 app (139 patients with a history of STB, 1,224 patients with no history of STB and 346 controls). For the MEmind app, participants were followed-up for a median of 49.5, resulting in 22,622 person-days. For the eB2 application, participants were followed-up for a median of 48.9 days, resulting in 83,521 person-days. EMA compliance rate was 65.00\% in suicidal patients and 75.21\% in student controls. At the end of the follow-up, over 60\% of participants remained in the study. Limitations Cases and controls were not matched by age and sex. Cases were patients who were receiving adequate psychopharmacological treatment and attending their appointments, which may result in an overstatement of clinical compliance. Conclusions Smartphone-based active and passive monitoring are feasible methods in psychiatric patients in real-world settings. The development of applications with friendly interfaces and directly useful features can help increase engagement without using incentives. The MEmind and eB2 applications are promising clinical tools that could contribute to the management of mental disorders. In the near future, these applications could serve as risk monitoring devices in the clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Background Accurate clinical prediction supports the effective treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and other psychiatric disorders. Traditional statistical techniques have identified patient characteristics associated with treatment outcomes. However, less work has focused on systematically leveraging these associations to create optimal predictive models. The current study demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict clinical outcomes in people completing outpatient AUD treatment. Method We used data from the COMBINE multisite clinical trial (n = 1383) to develop and test predictive models. We identified three priority prediction targets, including (1) heavy drinking during the first month of treatment, (2) heavy drinking during the last month of treatment, and (3) heavy drinking between weekly/bi-weekly sessions. Models were generated using the random forest algorithm. We used ``leave sites out'' partitioning to externally validate the models in trial sites that were not included in the model training. Stratified model development was used to test for sex differences in the relative importance of predictive features. Results Models predicting heavy alcohol use during the first and last months of treatment showed internal cross-validation area under the curve (AUC) scores ranging from 0.67 to 0.74. AUC was comparable in the external validation using data from held-out sites (AUC range = 0.69 to 0.72). The model predicting between-session heavy drinking showed strong classification accuracy in internal cross-validation (AUC = 0.89) and external test samples (AUC range = 0.80 to 0.87). Stratified analyses showed substantial sex differences in optimal feature sets. Conclusion Machine learning techniques can predict alcohol treatment outcomes using routinely collected clinical data. This technique has the potential to greatly improve clinical prediction accuracy without requiring expensive or invasive assessment methods. More research is needed to understand how best to deploy these models.},

In particular, we elaborate on the advantages of this Bayesian reform proposal under conditions of publication bias and other methodological imperfections that are typical of experimental research in the behavioral sciences.

  abstract = {This study examines relapse and recovery in Project MATCH. The study examines the transitions between periods of abstinence, lapse, and relapse. A set of proximal and distal variables were hypothesized to predict the likelihood of a transition to a different state over time using a semi-Markov model. The distal variables were stable predictors of relapse including severity of addiction, drug use, and psychiatric severity. The proximal predictors, which varied over time, included anger, symptoms of depression, action, struggling with maintenance, temptation, confidence, and social support. The study examined drinking outcomes of 469 individuals post-treatment and found that confidence to abstain and action orientation increased the probability of abstinence, and decreased the probability of lapsed and relapsed drinking. Confidence and endorsing action stage behaviors and attitudes were associated with the abstinence violation effect. The constructs of temptation and struggling with maintenance acted as risk factors for higher levels of drinking. Depression had mixed effects and appeared to be related to lapsed drinking more than relapsed drinking. Alcohol involvement acted as a risk factor for relapsed drinking. Information about the individuals drinking history was also examined. The number of prior episodes in abstinence or drinking states increased the probability of returning to the same types of abstinent or drinking behaviors. The length of each episode less frequently was significantly related to the transitions, However when significant, longer periods of abstinence and relapsed drinking were associated with less likely return to the same behaviors. Of particular note was that a history of relapsed drinking made lapsed drinking less likely, and a history of lapsed drinking made relapsed drinking less likely. This pattern supports the underlying division of drinking behaviors into the two categories of lapse and relapse. This study demonstrated that novel statistical methods such as Semi-Markov models can be used to investigate questions which could not be addressed or effectively answered with more commonly used methods. The semi-Markov models of transitions between drinking states helped to explain the complexity of the road to recovery.},

The study analyzed data from a population-based sample of adults with alcohol abuse and dependence in order to describe latent classes of individuals who reported one or more of 15 perceived barriers to seeking alcohol treatment and to identify characteristics associated with class membership. Methods: Data were from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (2001--2002). Analyses were restricted to treatment-naive adults with alcohol abuse or dependence who reported a perceived treatment need (N=1,053). Latent class analysis was performed to identify subgroups with respect to barriers to treatment. Latent class regression identified variables associated with each subgroup. Results: Two subgroups emerged: the low-barriers class (87\%), characterized primarily by attitudinal barriers, and the high-barriers class (13\%), characterized by significant attitudinal, financial, stigma, and readiness-for-change barriers. In both classes, the most frequently endorsed barrier was the attitudinal belief that ``I should be strong enough'' to handle the problem without treatment. Univariate analyses showed strong associations between membership in the high-barriers class and comorbid psychiatric disorders, alcohol dependence (compared with abuse), and a family history of alcohol problems. Multivariate analyses found significant associations with a lifetime anxiety disorder and with education level. Conclusions: Attitudinal barriers were most prevalent. Findings revealed a notable subgroup with multiple barriers, including financial and stigma-related barriers. This subgroup may require additional resources and support to enter treatment.},

This study replicates earlier work, documents the transition patterns within the cycle during a 3-year period, and identifies variables that predict these transitions. Data are from 1,326 adults recruited from sequential admissions to 12 substance abuse treatment facilities in Chicago, IL, between 1996 and 1998. Participants were predominantly female (60\%) and African American (88\%) adults. Participants were interviewed at intake, and at 6, 24, and 36 months post-intake follow-up rates ranged from 94\% to 98\% per wave. At each observation, participants' current status in the cycle was classified as (1) in the community using, (2) incarcerated, (3) in treatment, or (4) in the community not using. The transitional probabilities and correlates of pathways between these states were estimated. Over 83\% of the participants transitioned from one point in the cycle to another during the 3 years (including 36\% two times, 14\% three times). For the people in the community, about half remained in the same status (either using or abstinent) and just under half transitioned. The majority of people whose beginning status was incarceration or in-treatment also transitioned by the end of the observation period. While there was some overlap, predictors typically varied by pathway and direction (e.g., using to not using vs. not using to using). These results help demonstrate the need to adopt a chronic vs. acute care model for substance use. While exploratory and observational, several of the predictors are time-dependent and identify promising targets for interventions designed to shorten the cycle and increase the long-term effectiveness of treatment.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Ecological momentary assessments (EMA) are increasingly used in studies of smoking behavior. Through EMA, examination of lagged relationships is particularly useful for establishing a temporal order of events and for identifying types and timing of risk factors. The time-varying effect model (TVEM) handles EMA data challenges and addresses unique questions about the time-varying effects. Methods: Generalized TVEM was applied to EMA data from a smoking cessation study to investigate a ``time-varying lagged'' effect of negative affect on high smoking urges. Participants included 224 smokers with a smoking history of 23.1 years (SD = 9.8) smoking 27.3 cigarettes per day (SD = 10.7), which provided 11,394 EMAs following a quit attempt and prior to a smoking lapse. Results: The effect of negative affect was found to vary as a function of a time lag, with stronger immediate effects: estimated odds ratio (OR) of 2.7 for the lower nicotine-dependence group (time to first morning cigarette {$>$} 5min, 57.6\%) and OR of 2.4 for the higher nicotine-dependence group ({$\leq$} 5min). The magnitude of the effect persisted up to 7hr while decreasing over time. Conclusions: This analysis confirmed the importance of negative affect as a precursor of smoking urges while showing that the magnitude of the effect varies over time. An assumption of a constant lagged effect may bias estimates of the relationships and fail to provide a comprehensive outlook of the relational dynamics.},

Marlatt's taxonomy does not significantly predict drinking outcome, nor does it predict time to relapse. There is weak evidence, however, that under some circumstances Marlatt's taxonomy can predict the type of relapse subsequently observed. The alternative coding system also does not seem useful for predicting drinking outcome, although a possible association was found between internal attribution and time to return to heavy drinking. The alternative system does seem to be able to detect repetitive aspects of subsequent relapse situations; lack of social interactions, family setting, anxiety and depression were most likely to repeat. It may be useful to consider these relapse attributes in treatment planning. The minimal predictive validity for both the Marlatt and the alternative relapse code may be due to weaknesses in the relatively unstructured interview used to gather the data, or to failure to assess the most critical dimensions relating to subsequent relapse.},

  abstract = {Background and objectives Clinical staff providing addiction treatment predict patient outcome poorly. Prognoses based on linear statistics are rarely replicated. Addiction is a complex non-linear behavior. Incorporating non-linear models, Machine Learning (ML) has successfully predicted treatment outcome when applied in other areas of medicine. Using identical assessment data across the two groups, this study compares the accuracy of ML models versus clinical staff to predict alcohol dependence treatment outcome in behavior therapy using patient data only. Methods Machine learning models (n\,=\,28) were constructed (`trained') using demographic and psychometric assessment data from 780 previously treated patients who had undertaken a 12\,week, abstinence-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy program for alcohol dependence. Independent predictions applying assessment data for an additional 50 consecutive patients were obtained from 10 experienced addiction therapists and the 28 trained ML models. The predictive accuracy of the ML models and the addiction therapists was then compared with further investigation of the 10 best models selected by cross-validated accuracy on the training-set. Variables selected as important for prediction by staff and the most accurate ML model were examined. Results The most accurate ML model (Fuzzy Unordered Rule Induction Algorithm, 74\%) was significantly more accurate than the four least accurate clinical staff (51\%--40\%). However, the robustness of this finding may be limited by the moderate area under the receiver operator curve (AUC\,=\,0.49). There was no significant difference in mean aggregate predictive accuracy between 10 clinical staff (56.1\%) and the 28 best models (58.57\%). Addiction therapists favoured demographic and consumption variables compared with the ML model using more questionnaire subscales. Conclusions The majority of staff and ML models were not more accurate than suggested by chance. However, the best performing prediction models may provide useful adjunctive information to standard clinically available prognostic data to more effectively target treatment approaches in clinical settings.},

Machine learning (ML) offers the potential to model complex clinical data more effectively. This study tested the predictive accuracy of ML algorithms demonstrated to be effective in predicting alcohol dependence outcomes, compared with clinical judgement and traditional linear regression. Design Prospective study. ML models were trained on 1016 previously treated patients (training-set) who attended a hospital-based alcohol and drug clinic. ML models (n = 27), clinical psychologists (n = 10) and a `traditional' logistic regression model (n = 1) predicted treatment outcome during the initial treatment session of an alcohol dependence programme. Setting A 12-week cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-based abstinence programme for alcohol dependence in a hospital-based alcohol and drug clinic in Australia. Participants Prospective predictions were made for 220 new patients (test-set; 70.91\% male, mean age = 35.78 years, standard deviation = 9.19). Sixty-nine (31.36\%) patients successfully completed treatment. Measurements Treatment success was the primary outcome variable. The cross-validated training-set accuracy of ML models was used to determine optimal parameters for selecting models for prospective prediction. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operator curve (AUC), Brier score and calibration curves were calculated and compared across predictions. Findings The mean aggregate accuracy of the ML models (63.06\%) was higher than the mean accuracy of psychologist predictions (56.36\%). The most accurate ML model achieved 70\% accuracy, as did logistic regression. Both were more accurate than psychologists (P {$<$} 0.05) and had superior calibration. The high specificity for the selected ML (79\%) and logistic regression (90\%) meant they were significantly (P {$<$} 0.001) more effective than psychologists (50\%) at correctly identifying patients whose treatment was unsuccessful. For ML and logistic regression, high specificity came at the expense of sensitivity (26 and 31\%, respectively), resulting in poor prediction of successful patients. Conclusions Machine learning models and logistic regression appear to be more accurate than psychologists at predicting treatment outcomes in an abstinence programme for alcohol dependence, but sensitivity is low.},

  abstract = {Background Current modes of identifying alcohol misuse in hospitalized patients rely on self-report questionnaires and diagnostic codes that have limitations, including low sensitivity. Information in the clinical notes of the electronic health record (EHR) may further augment the identification of alcohol misuse. Natural language processing (NLP) with supervised machine learning has been successful at analyzing clinical notes and identifying cases of alcohol misuse in trauma patients. METHODS: An alcohol misuse NLP classifier, previously developed on trauma patients who completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, was validated in a cohort of 1000 hospitalized patients at a large, tertiary health system between January 1, 2007 and September 1, 2017. The clinical notes were processed using the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) guidelines for alcohol misuse were used during annotation of the medical records in our validation dataset. RESULTS: The alcohol misuse classifier had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 (95\% CI 0.90--0.93) in the cohort of hospitalized patients. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.88 (95\% CI 0.85--0.90), 0.78 (95\% CI 0.74--0.82), 0.85 (95\% CI 0.82--0.87), and 0.82 (95\% CI 0.78--0.86), respectively. The Hosmer--Lemeshow Test (p~=~0.13) demonstrates good model fit. Additionally, there was a dose-dependent response in alcohol consumption behaviors across increasing strata of predicted probabilities for alcohol misuse. CONCLUSION: The alcohol misuse NLP classifier had good discrimination and test characteristics in hospitalized patients. An approach using the clinical notes with NLP and supervised machine learning may better identify alcohol misuse cases than conventional methods solely relying on billing diagnostic codes.},

Though, a thorough understanding of experienced burden of and adherence to EMA is crucial in determining the usefulness of EMA. (2) Methods: Persons with current affective disorders (n = 100), remitted persons (n = 190), and healthy controls (n = 94) participated in a smartphone-based EMA two-week monitoring period. Our primary outcomes were (momentary) perceived burden of and adherence to EMA. (3) Results: In the whole sample, lower positive and higher negative affect were associated with slightly higher levels of perceived momentary burden (B = -0.23 [95\%CI = -0.27--0.19], B = 0.30 [95\%CI = 0.24--0.37], respectively). The persons with current affective disorders reported slightly higher levels of experienced momentary burden (Mdn = 1.98 [IQR = 1.28--2.57]), than the remitted persons (Mdn = 1.64 [IQR = 1.11--2.24]) and healthy controls (Mdn = 1.28 [IQR = 1.04--1.92]). Nevertheless, the persons with current affective disorders still showed very high adherence rates (Mdn = 94.3\% [IQR = 87.9--97.1]), at rates on a par with the remitted persons (Mdn = 94.3\% [IQR = 90.0--97.1]) and healthy controls (Mdn = 94.3\% [IQR = 90.0--98.6]). (4) Discussion: Frequent momentary questionnaires of mental well-being are slightly more burdensome to the persons with current affective disorders, but this does not seem to have a negative impact on adherence. Their high rate of adherence to EMA---which was similar to that in remitted persons and healthy controls ---suggests that it is feasible to apply (short-duration) EMA.},

  abstract = {Background Preoperative risky alcohol use is one of the most common surgical risk factors. Accurate and early identification of risky alcohol use could enhance surgical safety. Artificial Intelligence-based approaches, such as natural language processing (NLP), provide an innovative method to identify alcohol-related risks from patients' electronic health records (EHR) before surgery. Methods Clinical notes (n = 53,629) from pre-operative patients in a tertiary care facility were analyzed for evidence of risky alcohol use and alcohol use disorder. One hundred of these records were reviewed by experts and labeled for comparison. A rule-based NLP model was built, and we assessed the clinical notes for the entire population. Additionally, we assessed each record for the presence or absence of alcohol-related International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes as an additional comparator. Results NLP correctly identified 87\% of the human-labeled patients classified with risky alcohol use. In contrast, diagnosis codes alone correctly identified only 29\% of these patients. In terms of specificity, NLP correctly identified 84\% of the non-risky cohort, while diagnosis codes correctly identified 90\% of this cohort. In the analysis of the full dataset, the NLP-based approach identified three times more patients with risky alcohol use than ICD codes. Conclusions NLP, an artificial intelligence-based approach, efficiently and accurately identifies alcohol-related risk in patients' EHRs. This approach could supplement other alcohol screening tools to identify patients in need of intervention, treatment, and/or postoperative withdrawal prophylaxis. Alcohol-related ICD diagnosis had limited utility relative to NLP, which extracts richer information within clinical notes to classify patients.},

From a public health perspective, it is important to understand why people do not seek treatment. Objectives: This study aims to describe how people with alcohol dependence perceive and discuss treatment for alcohol use disorders and their reasons for seeking and not seeking treatment. Methods: 32 alcohol dependent adults from the general population participated in focus groups and individual interviews in Stockholm during 2011--2012. Data were analyzed with thematic content analysis. Results: Suffering from alcohol dependence, as well as realizing the need for, and entering treatment, were associated with shame and stigma, and were strong barriers to treatment. Other barriers included the desire to deal with alcohol problems on one's own and the view that seeking treatment required total abstinence. Negative health-effects were mainly a nonissue. The participants' knowledge about treatment options was limited to lifelong abstinence, medication with Disulfiram and residential treatment. These were seen as unappealing and contrasted sharply with preferred treatment. Conclusions/Importance: Public health literacy regarding alcohol use, dependence, and treatment ought to be improved in order to lower barriers to treatment. Treatment services need to better match the needs and wishes of potential service users, as well as taking stigmatization into account. In order to develop suitable treatments, and to reach the majority who do not seek treatment, the clinical understanding of alcohol dependence needs to be expanded to include mild to moderate dependence.},

In this article, we offer an overview of the history of the replication crisis, the critiques and reforms at the heart of the crisis, and several points of intersection between the reform movement and broader theoretical and philosophical issues.

  abstract = {The most widely cited road block to successful treatment outcomes for psychological and substance use disorders has been described as the return to the previous behavior, or ``relapse.'' The operational definition of ``relapse'' varies from study to study and between clinicians, but in general the term is used to indicate the return to previous levels of symptomatic behavior. One explanation for the variation in the operationalization of relapse is the wide variety of behaviors for which the term is applied, including (but not limited to): depression, substance abuse, schizophrenia, mania, sexual offending, risky sexual behavior, dieting, and the anxiety disorders. A second explanation for the multitude of definitions for relapse is the inherent complexity in the process of behavior change. In this paper we present the most recent treatment outcome research evaluating relapse rates, with a special focus on the substance use disorders. Following this review of the literature we present an argument for the operationalization of relapse as a dynamic process, which can be empirically characterized using dynamical systems theory. We support this argument by presenting results from the analysis of alcohol treatment outcomes using catastrophe modeling techniques. These results demonstrate the utility of catastrophe theory in modeling the alcohol relapse process.

  abstract = {Alcohol dependence has been described as a relapsing condition and it has been proposed that alcohol lapses could potentially be explained by dynamic associations between contextual, interpersonal, and intrapersonal risk factors. Yet, few studies have tested the associations between risk factors in the prediction of lapse dynamics. The current study was a secondary analysis of data from the COMBINE study (n = 1,383; COMBINE Study Research Group, 2003). The goal of the current study was to examine static (alcohol dependence severity, treatment history, marital status, psychiatric symptoms) and dynamic (negative affect, craving, stress) predictors of heavy drinking during the course of treatment and up to one year following treatment. Results from dynamic latent difference score models indicated that higher levels of static and dynamic risk and increased dynamic risk over time were significantly associated with greater increases in heavy drinking. Likewise, more frequent heavy drinking and higher static risk predicted higher levels of dynamic risk. In addition, changes in dynamic risk factors significantly mediated the association between changes in heavy drinking and both psychiatric symptoms and treatment history. It is important to note that while the effects of static and dynamic risk factors in the prediction of heavy drinking were statistically significant, the magnitude of the effects were small. The current study provided partial support for a dynamic model of relapse; however future research using intensive longitudinal data collection and more advanced statistical techniques could further elucidate lapse dynamics and potentially improve relapse prevention planning.},

This article provides an overview of the efficacy and effectiveness of relapse prevention in the treatment of addictive disorders, an update on recent empirical support for the elements of the cognitive-behavioral model of relapse, and a review of the criticisms of relapse prevention. In response to the criticisms, a reconceptualized cognitive-behavioral model of relapse that focuses on the dynamic interactions between multiple risk factors and situational determinants is proposed. Empirical support for this reconceptualization of relapse, the future of relapse prevention, and the limitations of the new model are discussed.

  abstract = {Background: Personal sensing may improve digital therapeutics for mental health care by facilitating early screening, symptom monitoring, risk prediction, and personalized adaptive interventions. However, further development and the use of personal sensing requires a better understanding of its acceptability to people targeted for these applications. Objective: We aimed to assess the acceptability of active and passive personal sensing methods in a sample of people with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder using both behavioral and self-report measures. This sample was recruited as part of a larger grant-funded project to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict lapses. Methods: Participants (N=154; n=77, 50\% female; mean age 41, SD 11.9 years; n=134, 87\% White and n=150, 97\% non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1-8 weeks of abstinence) were recruited to participate in a 3-month longitudinal study. Participants were modestly compensated for engaging with active (eg, ecological momentary assessment [EMA], audio check-in, and sleep quality) and passive (eg, geolocation, cellular communication logs, and SMS text message content) sensing methods that were selected to tap into constructs from the Relapse Prevention model by Marlatt. We assessed 3 behavioral indicators of acceptability: participants' choices about their participation in the study at various stages in the procedure, their choice to opt in to provide data for each sensing method, and their adherence to a subset of the active methods (EMA and audio check-in). We also assessed 3 self-report measures of acceptability (interference, dislike, and willingness to use for 1 year) for each method. Results: Of the 192 eligible individuals screened, 191 consented to personal sensing. Most of these individuals (169/191, 88.5\%) also returned 1 week later to formally enroll, and 154 participated through the first month follow-up visit. All participants in our analysis sample opted in to provide data for EMA, sleep quality, geolocation, and cellular communication logs. Out of 154 participants, 1 (0.6\%) did not provide SMS text message content and 3 (1.9\%) did not provide any audio check-ins. The average adherence rate for the 4 times daily EMA was .80. The adherence rate for the daily audio check-in was .54. Aggregate participant ratings indicated that all personal sensing methods were significantly more acceptable (all P\&lt;.001) compared with neutral across subjective measures of interference, dislike, and willingness to use for 1 year. Participants did not significantly differ in their dislike of active methods compared with passive methods (P=.23). However, participants reported a higher willingness to use passive (vs active) methods for 1 year (P=.04). Conclusions: These results suggest that active and passive sensing methods are acceptable for people with alcohol use disorder over a longer period than has previously been assessed. Important individual differences were observed across people and methods, indicating opportunities for future improvement.},

  abstract = {We developed three machine learning models that predict hour-by-hour probabilities of a future lapse back to alcohol use with increasing temporal precision (i.e., lapses in the next week, next day, and next hour). Model features were based on raw scores and longitudinal change in theoretically implicated risk factors collected through ecological momentary assessment. Participants (N = 151, 51\% male, Mage = 41, 87\% White, 97\% non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1--8 weeks of abstinence) from alcohol use disorder provided 4 {\texttimes} daily ecological momentary assessment for up to 3 months. We used grouped, nested cross-validation to select the best models and evaluate the performance of those best models. Models yielded median areas under the receiver operating curves of 0.89, 0.90, and 0.93 in the 30 held-out test sets for week-, day-, and hour-level models, respectively. Some feature categories consistently emerged as being globally important to lapse prediction across our week-, day-, and hour-level models (i.e., past use, future self-efficacy). However, most of the more punctate, time-varying constructs (e.g., craving, past stressful events, arousal) appear to have a greater impact within the next-hour prediction model. This research represents an important step toward the development of a smart (machine learning guided) sensing system that can both identify periods of peak lapse risk and recommend specific supports to address factors contributing to this risk.

  abstract = {Background Effective behavioral and pharmacological treatments are available and recommended for patients with alcohol use disorders (AUD) but rarely received. Barriers to receipt and provision of evidence-based AUD treatments delivered by specialists may be greatest in rural areas. Methods A targeted subanalysis of qualitative interview data collected from primary care providers at 5 Veterans Affairs clinics was conducted to identify differences in provider perceptions and practices regarding AUD treatment across urban and rural clinics. Key contacts were used to recruit 24 providers from 3 ``urban'' clinics at medical centers and 2 ``rural'' community-based outpatient clinics. Providers completed 30-minute semistructured interviews, which were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results Thirteen urban and 11 rural providers participated. Urban and rural providers differed regarding referral practices and in perceptions of availability and utility of specialty addictions treatment. Urban providers described referral to specialty treatment as standard practice, while rural providers reported substantial barriers to specialty care access and infrequent specialty care referral. Urban providers viewed specialty addictions treatment as accessible and comprehensive, and perceived addictions providers as ``experts'' and collaborators, whereas rural providers perceived inadequate support from the health care system for AUD treatment. Urban providers desired greater integration with specialty addictions care while rural providers wanted access to local addictions treatment resources. Conclusions Providers in rural settings view referral to specialty addictions treatment as impractical and resources inadequate to treat AUD. Additional work is needed to understand the unique needs of rural clinics and decrease barriers to AUD treatment.},
