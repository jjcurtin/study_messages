\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing disease (Dennis \&
Scott, 2007; McLellan et al., 2000; Rounsaville, 2010). Lapses, single
episodes of alcohol use, and relapse, a full return to harmful drinking,
can occur at any point in recovery (Kirshenbaum et al., 2009; Nguyen et
al., 2020; Scott et al., 2005; Witkiewitz, 2011). As with other chronic
health conditions where symptoms fluctuate, sometimes unexpectedly,
sustained AUD recovery requires ongoing monitoring of lapse risk.

Machine learning--guided recovery systems may now assist with the
inherently difficult task of identifying when and why someone is at
increased risk. Personal sensing of densely sampled data from
individuals' day-to-day lives can provide the inputs necessary for
temporally dynamic lapse predictions (Mohr et al., 2017). Early models
using ecological momentary assessment data have achieved excellent
accuracy (Chih et al., 2014; Wyant et al., 2024, under review). Still,
questions remain about the long-term feasibility of self-report sensing
methods and whether new, important risk factors might emerge from
sensing methods that passively collect smartphone data without user
input.

Cellular communication sensing may be one promising method. It offers
the potential for greater temporal specificity in capturing fluctuations
in risk compared with self-report data. Collecting communication data in
near real time could allow an algorithm to detect potential triggers as
they occur, without prompting users to reflect on their feelings or
waiting for users to report about their environment at a later point.
For example, late night phone calls could indicate an emergency, ``drunk
dialing'', or other risk-relevant interaction, while changes in the
number of unique contacts someone is interacting with could indicate an
expanding or shrinking social circle.

These data may become even more powerful when communications are
contextualized with personal meaning for a given participant (e.g., Who
is this contact to them? What is a typical interaction with them like?).
In this scenario, contextualized communication data might reveal that
the late-night phone call was to a sponsor, or that the shrinking social
circle was due to reduced contact with people who are unsupportive of
their recovery.

In this study, we evaluated the performance of a machine learning model
that predicts the probability of a next-day lapse using contextualized
cellular communication data. We also describe the most important
features contributing to these predictions, with the goal of identifying
new, clinically meaningful features emerging from communication-based
sensing.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Participants and
Procedure}\label{participants-and-procedure}

We recruited adults in early recovery from AUD in Madison, Wisconsin,
through print and digital advertisements and partnerships with treatment
centers. Eligibility criteria required that participants were age 18 or
older, able to read and write in English, had moderate to severe AUD
\footnote{(â‰¥4 self-reported DSM-5 symptoms)}, had been abstinent from
alcohol for 1--8 weeks, were willing to use a single smartphone, and
were not exhibiting severe psychosis or paranoia.\footnote{Defined as
  scores \textgreater2.2 or 2.8, respectively, on the psychosis or
  paranoia scales of the Symptom Checklist--90 (Derogatis, L.R., 2000).}

Participants completed up to 5 study visits over approximately 3 months:
a screening visit, intake visit, and 3 monthly follow-up visits. At
screening we collected demographic information (age, sex at birth, race,
ethnicity, education, marital status, employment, and income) and
clinical characteristics (DSM-5 AUD symptom count, alcohol problems
(Hurlbut \& Sher, 1992), and presence of psychological symptoms
(Derogatis, L.R., 2000)). At intake we collected additional self-report
data on abstinence self-efficacy (McKiernan et al., 2011), craving
(Flannery et al., 1999), and recent recovery efforts. At each monthly
follow-up, we downloaded cellular communication metadata (voice calls
and SMS text message logs) from participants' smartphones. We identified
important contacts (i.e., individuals they had communicated with at
least twice by call or text in the past month) and asked 7 contextual
questions about these contacts.

While enrolled, participants completed 4 brief daily ecological
momentary assessments (7-10 questions). The first item assessed alcohol
use (date and time of any unreported drinking episodes). Lapse reports
were verified at follow-up visits using a timeline follow-back
interview. Additional sensing data streams and self-report measures were
collected for the parent grant. The full study protocol is available on
our Open Science Framework page (\url{https://osf.io/wgpz9/}).

We screened 192 participants. Of these, 169 enrolled and 154 completed
the first follow-up. Data from 10 participants were excluded due to loss
of abstinence goals, careless responding, or unusually low compliance.
The final analytic sample included 144 participants.

\subsection{Data Analysis Plan}\label{data-analysis-plan}

Our models predicted the probability of an alcohol lapse within a
24-hour window. Predictions were generated daily at 4 a.m., beginning on
participants' second study day and continuing for up to 3 months. In
total, there were 11,507 labeled prediction windows across all
participants.

Features were engineered from all available data up to the start of each
window.\footnote{We filtered the data to include only communications
  with known context prior to feature engineering.} The full model
included 406 features from cellular communication data plus 24 features
from baseline self-report measures. We also evaluated a comparison model
that used only the baseline features. Table~\ref{tbl-1} details the raw
predictors and feature engineering procedures.

Candidate model configurations differed by algorithm (elastic net,
random forest, XGBoost), outcome resampling method, and hyperparameter
values. The best configuration for each model was selected using 6
repeats of participant-grouped 5-fold cross-validation. Our performance
metric was area under the receiver operating curve (auROC). Folds were
stratified by a between-subject measure of our outcome (low lapsers: 0-9
lapses; high lapsers: 10+ lapses).

We evaluated model performance with a Bayesian hierarchical generalized
linear model. Posterior distributions with 95\% credible intervals (CI)
were estimated from the 30 held-out test sets using weakly informative,
data-dependent priors to regularize and reduce overfitting.\footnote{Residual
  SD \textasciitilde{} normal(0, exp(2)); intercept (centered
  predictors) \textasciitilde{} normal(2.3, 1.3); window-width contrasts
  \textasciitilde{} normal(0, 2.69); covariance \textasciitilde{}
  decov(1,1,1,1).} Random intercepts were included for repeat and fold
(nested within repeat). auROCs were logit-transformed and regressed on
model type to estimate the probability that model performances differed
systematically.

Our best performing models used an elastic net algorithm. We quantified
feature importance by examining the retained features (i.e., coefficient
value \textgreater{} 0) in the full model and ordering them by absolute
coefficient value. These values provide an estimate of the direction and
magnitude of association between each predictor and the outcome,
conditional on the other features retained. All our annotated analysis
scripts are publicly available on our study website
(\url{https://jjcurtin.github.io/study_messages/}).

\subsection{Model Evaluation}\label{model-evaluation}

The median posterior auROC for the full model was 0.68, with relatively
narrow 95\% CI ({[}0.64, 0.71{]}) that did not contain .5. This provides
strong evidence that the model is capturing signal in the data. The
final model retained 13 features (Figure~\ref{fig-1}). The top four were
baseline measures of abstinence confidence, having a goal of abstinence,
abstinence self-efficacy when experiencing negative affect, and craving.
Communication frequency with people unaware of the individual's recovery
goals also emerged as an important feature associated with increased
lapse risk.

We evaluated a comparison model to assess the incremental predictive
value of cellular communication features beyond baseline measures. The
baseline model retained 5 features and achieved performance nearly
identical to the full model (median auROC = 0.68, 95\% CI {[}0.64,
0.71{]}). The median difference in auROC between the full and baseline
models was less than .01, providing no evidence (52\% probability) that
their posterior distributions were meaningfully different.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Our model achieved fair performance, with an auROC of 0.68, indicating
that some predictive signal was present. However, it did not offer
incremental value beyond a baseline model that included only demographic
and self-report measures. Consistent with this, the four most important
predictors in our model were all self-report variables: abstinence
confidence, abstinence goal, negative affect efficacy, and craving.

Nonetheless, several communication features were retained in the final
model with moderately sized coefficients. These included communications
with people unaware of the participant's recovery status, non-drinkers,
friends, and individuals who were unpleasant to interact with. In
contrast, raw counts of calls and text messages and call durations were
not retained in the final model. This implies that the quantity of
communication may be less informative than the quality and social
significance. Future research may benefit from collecting richer
contextual data about communication contacts to better understand the
social dynamics contributing to lapse risk.

Even with highly contextualized communication data, however, prediction
may be limited by data sparsity. Many participants had few daily
communications, and some had extended periods with no recorded
interactions at all. Our study design may have further contributed to
this limitation. We collected only phone and SMS text communications
through the native smartphone app. In recent years, many individuals use
private messaging apps (e.g., WhatsApp, Signal) or social media
platforms (e.g., Facebook Messenger, Instagram) as their primary
communication method (McDowell et al., 2025). Therefore, our dataset
likely missed a substantial portion of participants' communications.
Future studies could explore whether data from these platforms yield
stronger predictive signals.

We cannot entirely dismiss the potential value of cellular communication
data for risk prediction. For example, researchers have successfully
incorporated communication data into models with other sensing data
(e.g., accelerometer, geolocation, and device usage) to predict alcohol
use episodes (S. Bae et al., 2017; S. W. Bae et al., 2023). However,
even in these instances, the contribution of cellular communications is
questionable and other sensing methods like geolocation appear to be
more promising. Other practical challenges for collecting call and text
message data further limit the feasibility of this sensing method (e.g.,
Apple heavily restricts the collection of these data by apps in their
app store). We conclude that other forms of social interaction
characterization (e.g., engineering time spent with supportive contacts
from geolocation data) are more worthwhile to pursue in future research.
