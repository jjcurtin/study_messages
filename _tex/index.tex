\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

One of the biggest challenges in Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) treatment
stems from the chronic relapsing nature of this disease (Scott et al.,
2005). People can relapse days, weeks, and even years after obtaining
the goal of abstinence. At least 60\% of AUD patients relapse to heavy
drinking within 6 months following treatment (Kirshenbaum et al., 2009;
Nguyen et al., 2020; Witkiewitz, 2011). At most 50\% of people with an
AUD achieve remission after several years (Fleury et al., 2016; Heyman,
2013).

Identifying initial lapses in early recovery is critical. Lapses --
single episodes of alcohol use -- are easy to define, have a clear
onset, and are also clinically meaningful. They serve as an early
warning sign of returning back to previous drinking behavior
inconsistent with desired goals (Chung \& Maisto, 2006; Marlatt \&
Donovan, 2005; Witkiewitz \& Marlatt, 2004). Lapse predicts future
lapses, with more frequent ones resulting in increased risks of relapse
(Högström Brandt et al., 1999; Witkiewitz \& Marlatt, 2004).

Current predictions of alcohol lapses rely heavily on self reports,
which can be burdensome to measure in long run. Machine learning models
leveraging ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measures have performed
relatively well to predict goal-inconsistent alcohol use (Wyant et al.,
2024). The surveys were collected up to four times daily for three
months. However, constantly completing surveys makes it burdensome for
AUD patients. Although most EMA relevant mental health research
demonstrated modest compliance rates, their time windows last from two
weeks to three months (Czyz et al., 2018; Hung et al., 2016;
Mackesy-Amiti \& Boodram, 2018; Porras-Segovia et al., 2020; van
Genugten et al., 2020). The study length is insufficient because AUD is
a chronic disease that requires constant risk monitoring. As extended
period of time is anticipated, users' perceived burden of answering
surveys is presumably larger (Mogk et al., 2023). Although minimizing
the number of items in the surveys and the frequency of prompting users
to complete the surveys might help mitigate the associated burden, it
can inevitably reduce the prediction precision and temporal precision of
predictions.

Passive cellular communication sensing represents new opportunities due
to its feasibility, relatively low burden on individuals and continuous
data collection. In a smartphone-based sensing platform the primary
expense on the individual is the smartphone. Smartphone usage is already
widespread. Eighty-five percent of US adults have a smartphone and this
number is consistent across all sociodemographic groups, including those
in recovery programs for substance use (Center, 2021; Masson et al.,
2019). Studies collecting passive data have demonstrated high
acceptability from participants and higher compliance rates compared to
active measures (Beukenhorst et al., 2022; Wyant et al., 2023). Further,
risk monitoring using cellular sensing is temporally sensitive to
fluctuating risks. Analyzing communication patterns can detect potential
triggers in time without actively prompting users to reflect on their
feelings at the moment or report their environment.

Cellular communications, with minimal contextual information, is
embedded with potentially rich information that align with relapse
antecedents. For example, social interactions can have important
influences on drinking behavior (Alvarez et al., 2021; Hunter-Reel et
al., 2009). We may be able to capture immediate risk based on who
someone is calling or what time of day it is. Decreased interactions may
signify isolation common with depressive symptoms, reaching out to
people in one's social network could signify a positive coping strategy,
or changes in patterns between a single person in one's social network
could indicate conflict (Chih et al., 2014; Hufford et al., 2003; Miller
et al., 2001).

This study aims at building machine learning models from cellular
communications that identify \emph{who} are at heightened risk for
alcohol lapses, \emph{when} they will lapse, and \emph{why} they are at
increased risk.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Participants and
Procedure}\label{participants-and-procedure}

We recruited adults in early recovery from AUD in Madison, Wisconsin,
through print and digital advertisements and partnerships with treatment
centers. Eligibility criteria required that participants were age 18 or
older, able to read and write in English, had moderate to severe AUD
\footnote{(≥4 self-reported DSM-5 symptoms)}, had been abstinent from
alcohol for 1--8 weeks, were willing to use a single smartphone, and
were not exhibiting severe psychosis or paranoia.\footnote{Defined as
  scores \textgreater2.2 or 2.8, respectively, on the psychosis or
  paranoia scales of the Symptom Checklist--90 (Derogatis, L.R., 2000).}

Participants completed up to 5 study visits over approximately 3 months:
a screening visit, intake visit, and 3 monthly follow-up visits. At
screening we collected demographic information (age, sex at birth, race,
ethnicity, education, marital status, employment, and income) and
clinical characteristics (DSM-5 AUD symptom count, alcohol problems
(Hurlbut \& Sher, 1992), and presence of psychological symptoms
(Derogatis, L.R., 2000)). At intake we collected additional self-report
data on abstinence self-efficacy (McKiernan et al., 2011), craving
(Flannery et al., 1999), and recent recovery efforts. At each monthly
follow-up, we downloaded cellular communication metadata (voice calls
and SMS text message logs) from participants' smartphones. We identified
important contacts (i.e., individuals they had communicated with at
least twice by call or text in the past month) and asked 7 contextual
questions about these contacts.

While enrolled, participants completed 4 brief daily ecological
momentary assessments (7-10 questions). The first item assessed alcohol
use (date and time of any unreported drinking episodes). Lapse reports
were verified at follow-up visits using a timeline follow-back
interview. Additional sensing data streams and self-report measures were
collected for the parent grant. The full study protocol is available on
our Open Science Framework page (\url{https://osf.io/wgpz9/}).

We screened 192 participants. Of these, 169 enrolled and 154 completed
the first follow-up. Data from 10 participants were excluded due to loss
of abstinence goals, careless responding, or unusually low compliance.
The final analytic sample included 144 participants.

\subsection{Data Analysis Plan}\label{data-analysis-plan}

Our models predicted the probability of an alcohol lapse within a
24-hour window. Predictions were generated daily at 4 a.m., beginning on
participants' second study day and continuing for up to 3 months. In
total, there were 11,507 labeled prediction windows across all
participants.

Features were engineered from all available data up to the start of each
window.\footnote{We filtered the data to include only communications
  with known context prior to feature engineering.} The full model
included 406 features from cellular communication data plus 24 features
from baseline self-report measures. We also evaluated a comparison model
that used only the baseline features. Table~\ref{tbl-1} details the raw
predictors and feature engineering procedures.

Candidate model configurations differed by algorithm (elastic net,
random forest, XGBoost), outcome resampling method, and hyperparemter
values. The best configuration for each model was selected using 6
repeats of participant-grouped 5-fold cross-validation. Our performance
metric was area under the receiver operating curve (auROC). Folds were
stratified by a between-subject measure of our outcome (low lapsers: 0-9
lapses; high lapsers: 10+ lapses).

We evaluated model performance with a Bayesian hierarchical generalized
linear model. Posterior distributions with 95\% credible intervals (CIs)
were estimated from the 30 held-out test sets using weakly informative,
data-dependent priors to regularize and reduce overfitting.\footnote{Residual
  SD \textasciitilde{} normal(0, exp(2)); intercept (centered
  predictors) \textasciitilde{} normal(2.3, 1.3); window-width contrasts
  \textasciitilde{} normal(0, 2.69); covariance \textasciitilde{}
  decov(1,1,1,1).} Random intercepts were included for repeat and fold
(nested within repeat). auROCs were logit-transformed and regressed on
model type to estimate the probability that model performances differed
systematically.

Our best performing models used an elastic net algorithm. We quantified
feature importance by examining the retained features (i.e., coefficient
value \textgreater{} 0) in the full model and ordering them by absolute
coefficient value. These values provide an estimate of the direction and
magnitude of association between each predictor and the outcome,
conditional on the other features retained. All our annotated analysis
scripts are publicly available on our study website
(\url{https://jjcurtin.github.io/study_messages/}).

\subsection{Model Evaluation}\label{model-evaluation}

The median posterior probability for auROC for the full model was 0.68.
The 95\% CIs were relatively narrow ({[}0.64, 0.71{]}) and did not
contain .5, providing strong evidence that the model is capturing signal
in the data. The final model retained 13 features (Figure~\ref{fig-1}).
The top four features were baseline measures of abstinence confidence,
having a goal of abstinence, abstinence self-efficacy when experiencing
negative affect, and craving. Communication frequency with people who
don't know about the individual's recovery goals also appeared to be an
important feature for increasing lapse risk.

\subsection{Model Comparison}\label{model-comparison}

We evaluated a comparison model to determine the extent that cellular
communications were adding predictive value above and beyond the
baseline features. The baseline model retained 5 features and obtained
performance nearly identical to the full model (median auROC 0.68, 95\%
CIs {[}0.64, 0.71{]}). There was a median difference in auROC of the
full and baseline models of less than .01, yielding no evidence (52\%
probability) that the posterior distributions were meaningfully
different.
