<meta name="citation_title" content="Evaluating Cellular Communication Sensing for Lapse Risk Prediction During Early Recovery from Alcohol Use Disorder">
<meta name="citation_abstract" content="Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing disease. An automated recovery support system powered by personal sensing and machine learning may assist with the inherently difficult task of identifying when and why an individual is at increased risk for lapse. Cellular communication sensing may be one promising method for detecting dynamic changes in lapse risk. Moreover, these communications can be contextualized with self-reported, risk-relevant information about the contact. In this study, we evaluated the performance of a machine learning model that predicts the probability of next-day alcohol lapse among individuals (N = 144) in early recovery from AUD using contextualized cellular communication data and baseline demographic and AUD characteristics. The best-performing model used an elastic net algorithm and retained 13 features. The median posterior auROC for the best model was 0.68, with a relatively narrow 95% Bayesian confidence interval (CI; [0.64, 0.71]) that did not include 0.5. We also evaluated a comparison model to assess the incremental predictive value of cellular communication features beyond baseline measures. The baseline model retained five features and achieved performance nearly identical to that of the full model (median auROC = 0.68, 95% CI [0.64, 0.71]). These results indicate that cellular communication data capture some risk-relevant signal for alcohol lapse; however, they do not provide incremental predictive value beyond a baseline model that included only demographic and self-report measures. Several communication features were retained in the final model with moderately sized coefficients, suggesting that aspects of social communication may be important for understanding lapse risk. Nonetheless, limitations inherent to cellular communication as a sensing method may outweigh their added value.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Availability of Medications for the Treatment of Alcohol and Opioid Use Disorder in the USA;,citation_abstract=Despite high mortality rates due to opioid overdose and excessive alcohol consumption, medications for the treatment of alcohol and opioid use disorder have not been widely used in the USA. This paper provides an overview of the literature on the availability of alcohol and opioid used disorder medications in the specialty substance use disorder treatment system, other treatment settings and systems, and among providers with a federal waiver to prescribe buprenorphine. We also present the most current data on the availability of alcohol and opioid use disorder medications in the USA. These estimates show steady growth in availability of opioid use disorder medications over the past decade and a decline in availability of alcohol use disorder medications. However, overall use of medications in the USA remains low. In 2017, only 16.3% of specialty treatment programs offered any single medication for alcohol use disorder treatment and 35.5% offered any single medication for opioid use disorder treatment. Availability of buprenorphine-waivered providers has increased significantly since 2002. However, geographic disparities in access to buprenorphine remain. Some of the most promising strategies to increase availability of alcohol and opioid use disorder medications include the following: incorporating substance use disorder training in healthcare education programs, educating the substance use disorder workforce about the benefits of medication treatment, reducing stigma surrounding the use of medications, implementing medications in primary care settings, implementing integrated care models, revising regulations on methadone and buprenorphine, improving health insurance coverage of medications, and developing novel medications for the treatment of substance use disorder.;,citation_author=Amanda J.

Information in the clinical notes of the electronic health record of trauma patients may be used for phenotyping tasks with natural language processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning. The objective of this study is to train and validate an NLP classifier for identifying patients with alcohol misuse.An observational cohort of 1422 adult patients admitted to a trauma center between April 2013 and November 2016. Linguistic processing of clinical notes was performed using the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System. The primary analysis was the binary classification of alcohol misuse. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test served as the reference standard.The data corpus comprised 91 045 electronic health record notes and 16 091 features. In the final machine learning classifier, 16 features were selected from the first 24 hours of notes for identifying alcohol misuse. The classifier’s performance in the validation cohort had an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.85). Sensitivity and specificity were at 56.0% (95% CI, 44.1% to 68.0%) and 88.9% (95% CI, 84.4% to 92.8%). The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test demonstrates the classifier fits the data well (P = .17). A simpler rule-based keyword approach had a decrease in sensitivity when compared with the NLP classifier from 56.0% to 18.2%.The NLP classifier has adequate predictive validity for identifying alcohol misuse in trauma centers.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine-learning prediction of adolescent alcohol use: A cross-study, cross-cultural validation;,citation_abstract=Background and aims The experience of alcohol use among adolescents is complex, with international differences in age of purchase and individual differences in consumption and consequences. This latter underlines the importance of prediction modeling of adolescent alcohol use. The current study (a) compared the performance of seven machine-learning algorithms to predict different levels of alcohol use in mid-adolescence and (b) used a cross-cultural cross-study scheme in the training-validation-test process to display the predictive power of the best performing machine-learning algorithm. Design A comparison of seven machine-learning algorithms: logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, neural network, lasso regression, ridge regression and elastic-net. Setting Canada and Australia. Participants The Canadian sample is part of a 4-year follow-up (2012–16) of the Co-Venture cohort (n = 3826, baseline age 12.8  0.4, 49.2% girls). The Australian sample is part of a 3-year follow-up (2012–15) of the Climate Schools and Preventure (CAP) cohort (n = 2190, baseline age 13.3  0.3, 43.7% girls). Measurements The algorithms used several prediction indices, such as F1 prediction score, accuracy, precision, recall, negative predictive value and area under the curve (AUC). Findings Based on prediction indices, the elastic-net machine-learning algorithm showed the best predictive performance in both Canadian (AUC = 0.869  0.066) and Australian (AUC = 0.855  0.072) samples. Domain contribution analysis showed that the highest prediction accuracy indices yielded from models with only psychopathology (AUC = 0.816  0.044/0.790  0.071 in Canada/Australia) and only personality clusters (AUC = 0.776  0.063/0.796  0.066 in Canada/Australia). Similarly, regardless of the level of alcohol use, in both samples, externalizing psychopathologies, alcohol use at baseline and the sensation-seeking personality profile contributed to the prediction.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Social network heavy drinking moderates the effects of a brief motivational intervention for alcohol use among injured patients;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Limited research has focused on identifying the extent to which social networks impact the effectiveness of brief alcohol interventions delivered in trauma care settings. OBJECTIVES: The research presented here examines the extent to which the percent of heavy drinkers and percent of abstainers in one’s social network moderates the effectiveness of a brief motivational intervention with and without a telephone booster on alcohol use among trauma patients. METHOD: Secondary data analyses were conducted using data from 596 participants (456males) who were recruited from three urban Level I trauma centers. Patients were randomized to one of the three intervention conditions: brief advice (BA; n&nbsp;=&nbsp;200), brief motivational intervention (BMI; n&nbsp;=&nbsp;203), and BMI with a telephone booster (BMI&nbsp;+&nbsp;B; n&nbsp;=&nbsp;193). For the purpose of the present study, measures of alcohol-specific social network characteristics at baseline and alcohol use at 3- and 6-month follow-up were used. RESULTS: At low percentages (0% to ~7%) of people in one’s social network who are heavy drinkers, there was a negative, statistically significant effect of the BMI conditions versus the BA condition on alcohol use. However, percent of abstainers did not moderate the effects of the BMI conditions. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the BMI and BMI&nbsp;+&nbsp;B conditions may be most effective among patients with no heavy drinkers in their social networks. BMIs may benefit from including a component that addresses having one or more heavy drinkers in one’s social network.;,citation_author=Miriam J. Alvarez;,citation_author=Dylan K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An Automated System for Identifying Alcohol Use Status from Clinical Text;,citation_abstract=Alcohol use is one of the main risk factors related to many diseases. However, alcohol use information is buried in the patient’s clinical records, and extracting this information from narrative text requires substantial manual labor. This work aims to develop an automated system for detecting alcohol use status from patients’ discharge summaries. A combination of machine learning and rule-based techniques has been employed in order to identify alcohol status in three stages. In the first stage, the proposed system detects alcohol-related sentences by utilizing a keyword search technique. The second stage distinguishes between the negative and positive alcohol sentences and identifies the temporal status. In this stage different machine learning classifiers have been employed in order to achieve the best performance. Finally, the document level alcohol use status is aggregated from the sentence-level for each patient’s record. The proposed system exhibits high performance in identifying alcohol use status, achieving an Fl-score up to 0.99 in identifying alcohol use related records, 0.96 in detecting negative records and 0.89 identifying temporal status.;,citation_author=Hadeel Alzoubi;,citation_author=Naeem Ramzan;,citation_author=Raid Alzubi;,citation_author=Ehsan Mesbahi;,citation_publication_date=2018-08;,citation_cover_date=2018-08;,citation_year=2018;,citation_doi=10.1109/iCCECOME.2018.8658578;,citation_conference_title=2018 International Conference on Computing, Electronics &amp;amp;amp; Communications Engineering (iCCECE);">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Inferential Statistics as Descriptive Statistics: There Is No Replication Crisis if We Don’t Expect Replication;,citation_abstract=Statistical inference often fails to replicate. One reason is that many results may be selected for drawing inference because some threshold of a statistic like the P-value was crossed, leading to biased reported effect sizes. Nonetheless, considerable non-replication is to be expected even without selective reporting, and generalizations from single studies are rarely if ever warranted. Honestly reported results must vary from replication to replication because of varying assumption violations and random variation; excessive agreement itself would suggest deeper problems, such as failure to publish results in conflict with group expectations or desires. A general perception of a “replication crisis” may thus reflect failure to recognize that statistical tests not only test hypotheses, but countless assumptions and the entire environment in which research takes place. Because of all the uncertain and unknown assumptions that underpin statistical inferences, we should treat inferential statistics as highly unstable local descriptions of relations between assumptions and data, rather than as providing generalizable inferences about hypotheses or models. And that means we should treat statistical results as being much more incomplete and uncertain than is currently the norm. Acknowledging this uncertainty could help reduce the allure of selective reporting: Since a small P-value could be large in a replication study, and a large P-value could be small, there is simply no need to selectively report studies based on statistical results. Rather than focusing our study reports on uncertain conclusions, we should thus focus on describing accurately how the study was conducted, what problems occurred, what data were obtained, what analysis methods were used and why, and what output those methods produced.;,citation_author=Valentin Amrhein;,citation_author=David Trafimow;,citation_author=Sander Greenland;,citation_publication_date=2019-03;,citation_cover_date=2019-03;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=sup1;,citation_doi=10.1080/00031305.2018.1543137;,citation_issn=0003-1305;,citation_volume=73;,citation_journal_title=The American Statistician;,citation_publisher=Taylor &amp;amp;amp; Francis;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relapse after inpatient substance use treatment: A prospective cohort study among users of illicit substances;,citation_abstract=AIMS: The main aim was to investigate the relative roles of mental distress and intrinsic motivation for relapse after inpatient substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, while adjusting for demographics and treatment variables. METHODS: The study is based on a prospective multicenter study with a baseline gross sample of 607 patients with SUD (response rate = 84%) admitted to an inpatient stay at one of five specialized SUD treatment centers in Norway. The analytical sample consisted of patients with illicit drug use (n = 374) who took part in a follow-up interview three months after discharge from inpatient treatment (n = 249) (retention rate = 67%). Data were collected using information from electronic medical records, a self-report questionnaire at treatment entry, and a follow-up interview. RESULTS: Relapse occurred among 37% of the sample by three-month follow-up. Results of multivariable analysis showed that younger age and having a psychiatric diagnosis were associated with an elevated relapse risk. Patients who received treatment at a short-term clinic (2-4 months), as opposed to a long-term clinic ($&amp;amp;amp;gt;$6 months) were also at increased risk of relapse, regardless of their length of stay. Reduced risk of relapse was predicted by having completed the inpatient treatment stay. CONCLUSION: Identifying the treatment needs of young patients and patients with co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses during and following inpatient SUD treatment may contribute to reduced post-treatment relapse rates. Further research is needed to illuminate the treatment-related factors that contribute to reduced risk of relapse after inpatient SUD treatment.;,citation_author=Helle Wessel Andersson;,citation_author=Merethe Wenaas;,citation_author=Trond Nordfjærn;,citation_publication_date=2019-03;,citation_cover_date=2019-03;,citation_year=2019;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2018.11.008;,citation_issn=1873-6327;,citation_pmid=30447514;,citation_volume=90;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Addictive Behaviors;">

In this paper, we approach a machinelearning-based way to forecast the risk of becoming addicted to drugs using machine-learning algorithms. First, we find some significant factors for addiction by talking to doctors, drug-addicted people, and read relevant articles and write-ups. Then we collect data from both addicted and nonaddicted people. After preprocessing the data set, we apply nine conspicuous machine learning algorithms, namely k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, SVM, naïve bayes, classification, and regression trees, random forest, multilayer perception, adaptive boosting, and gradient boosting machine on our processed data set and measure the performances of each of these classifiers in terms of some prominent performance metrics. Logistic regression is found outperforming all other classifiers in terms of all metrics used by attaining an accuracy approaching 97.91%.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Leveraging Mobile Phone Sensors, Machine Learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence to Predict Imminent Same-Day Binge Drinking Events to Support Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions: A Feasibility Study;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Digital Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) can reduce binge drinking events (BDEs: consuming 4+/5+ drinks per occasion for women/men) in young adults, but need to be optimized for timing and content. Delivering just-in-time support messages in the hours prior to BDEs could improve intervention impact. OBJECTIVE: We determined the feasibility of developing a machine learning model to accurately predict future, that is, same-day, 1 to 6-hours prior BDEs using smartphone sensor data. We aimed to identify the most informative phone sensor features associated with BDEs on weekend and weekdays, respectively, to determine the key features that explain prediction model performance. METHODS: We collected phone sensor data from 75 young adults (ages 21-25; mean =22.4, SD=1.9) with risky drinking behavior who reported drinking behavior over 14 weeks. Participants in this secondary analysis were enrolled in a clinical trial. We developed machine learning models testing different algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, decision tree) to predict same-day BDEs (versus low-risk drinking events and non-drinking periods) using smartphone sensor data (e.g., accelerometer, GPS). We tested various &amp;amp;amp;quot;prediction distance&amp;quot; time windows (more proximal: 1-hour; to distant: 6-hour) from drinking onset. We also tested various analysis time windows (i.e., amount of data to be analyzed), ranging from 1 to 12 hours prior to drinking onset, because this determines the amount of data that needs to be stored on the phone to compute the model. Explainable AI (XAI) was used to explore interactions between the most informative phone sensor features contributing to BDEs. RESULTS: The XGBoost model performed best in predicting imminent same-day BDE, with 95.0% accuracy on weekends and 94.3% accuracy on weekdays (F1 score = 0.95 and 0.94, respectively). This XGBoost model needed 12- and 9-hours of phone sensor data at 3- and 6- hours prediction distance from the onset of drinking, on weekends and weekdays, respectively, prior to predicting same-day BDEs. The most informative phone sensor features for BDE prediction were time (e.g., time of day) and GPS-derived, such as radius of gyration (an indicator of travel). Interactions among key features (e.g., time of day, GPS-derived features) contributed to prediction of same-day BDE. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the feasibility and potential use of smartphone sensor data and machine learning to accurately predict imminent (same-day) BDEs in young adults. The prediction model provides &quot;windows of opportunity&quot; and with the adoption of XAI, we identified &quot;key contributing features&quot; to trigger JITAI prior to the onset of BDEs, with the potential to reduce the likelihood of BDEs in young adults.;,citation_author=Sang Won Bae;,citation_author=Brian Suffoletto;,citation_author=Tongze Zhang;,citation_author=Tammy Chung;,citation_author=Melik Ozolcer;,citation_author=Mohammad Rahul Islam;,citation_author=Anind Dey;,citation_publication_date=2023-02;,citation_cover_date=2023-02;,citation_year=2023;,citation_doi=10.2196/39862;,citation_issn=2561-326X;,citation_pmid=36809294;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=JMIR formative research;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mobile phone sensors and supervised machine learning to identify alcohol use events in young adults: Implications for just-in-time adaptive interventions;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Real-time detection of drinking could improve timely delivery of interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related injury, but existing detection methods are burdensome or impractical. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether phone sensor data and machine learning models are useful to detect alcohol use events, and to discuss implications of these results for just-in-time mobile interventions. METHODS: 38 non-treatment seeking young adult heavy drinkers downloaded AWARE app (which continuously collected mobile phone sensor data), and reported alcohol consumption (number of drinks, start/end time of prior day’s drinking) for 28days. We tested various machine learning models using the 20 most informative sensor features to classify time periods as non-drinking, low-risk (1 to 3/4 drinks per occasion for women/men), and high-risk drinking ($&amp;amp;amp;gt;$4/5 drinks per occasion for women/men). RESULTS: Among 30 participants in the analyses, 207 non-drinking, 41 low-risk, and 45 high-risk drinking episodes were reported. A Random Forest model using 30-min windows with 1day of historical data performed best for detecting high-risk drinking, correctly classifying high-risk drinking windows 90.9% of the time. The most informative sensor features were related to time (i.e., day of week, time of day), movement (e.g., change in activities), device usage (e.g., screen duration), and communication (e.g., call duration, typing speed). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence suggests that sensor data captured from mobile phones of young adults is useful in building accurate models to detect periods of high-risk drinking. Interventions using mobile phone sensor features could trigger delivery of a range of interventions to potentially improve effectiveness.;,citation_author=Sangwon Bae;,citation_author=Tammy Chung;,citation_author=Denzil Ferreira;,citation_author=Anind K.

More specifically, the purpose was to determine, not only how frequently these symbolic expressions are used, but how they are utilized in terms of the language functions that they signal. The results of this investigation suggest that text messaging symbols are most frequently used to identify people and their relationships to other things (including other people). They also suggest that text messaging symbols are frequently used to express amusement. In addition, the results suggest that the text messaging community has developed its own language culture in which closing expressions, long-form dialog, and correct spelling and grammar are viewed as inefficient and impractical. Finally, the results suggest that text messaging symbols are often used to signal descriptions of things that are important to the message sender.;,citation_author=Robert E.

Addiction-comprehensive health enhancement support system (A-CHESS) is a smartphone application that aims to reduce relapse. To offer targeted support to patients who are at risk of lapses within the coming week, a Bayesian network model to predict such events was constructed using responses on 2,934 weekly surveys (called the Weekly Check-in) from 152 alcohol-dependent individuals who recently completed residential treatment. The Weekly Check-in is a self-monitoring service, provided in A-CHESS, to track patients’ recovery progress. The model showed good predictability, with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.829 in the 10-fold cross-validation and 0.912 in the external validation.

Although rates of and time to relapse appear to be similar for treated adolescents and adults, this critical review of the literature on adolescent relapse begins with an overview of developmental differences between adolescent and adult substance users that need to be considered when studying relapse. A summary of rates of relapse in treated teens is followed by a review of results on the predictive validity of different relapse definitions. Next, characteristics of teens’ initial relapse in terms of substances involved, situational context, and factors associated with relapse are described. Because relapse is ideally understood in the context of longer-term patterns of use, the review also discusses the extent to which early episodes of use mark clinically significant change points in post-treatment course, and how knowledge of longer-term clinical course is essential to understanding the relapse process and mechanisms underlying the maintenance of behavioral change.;,citation_author=Tammy Chung;,citation_author=Stephen A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Recovery and Recovery Capital: Aligning Measurement with Theory and Practice;,citation_abstract=Although most conceptualizations of recovery from substance use disorders place abstinence at their core, the process of recovery also includes improvements to individual well-being that go beyond abstinence or remission. The process of recovery is heterogeneous and is often exemplified in different ways for different people and in different contexts. In this chapter, we argue that the process of initiating and sustaining long-term recovery is dynamic and can vary across individuals. Recovery being dynamic means that what recovery looks like for a given individual may shift across time and context. Similarly, one person may base their recovery on very different daily routines than another person. As a result, the resources used to initiate and sustain recovery, referred to as recovery capital, also necessarily vary by time, context, and person. Although a simple premise, this argument has profound impact on measurement: both the process of recovery and transactions with recovery capital must be measured on timescales that make it possible to analyze changes in the recovery process as they unfold within each individual. That is, our measurement of recovery should allow description of the process and outcomes of successful recovery for each individual, and the ways that those processes may change (i.e., the dynamics of the process) in that person over time and context. We must also ensure that our understanding of recovery capital is sufficiently robust to capture the way that the resources that support recovery and recovery well-being vary between and within individuals over time and across contexts.;,citation_author=H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Associations Between Socioeconomic Factors and Alcohol Outcomes;,citation_abstract=Socioeconomic status (SES) is one of the many factors influencing a person’s alcohol use and related outcomes. Findings have indicated that people with higher SES may consume similar or greater amounts of alcohol compared with people with lower SES, although the latter group seems to bear a disproportionate burden of negative alcohol-related consequences. These associations are further complicated by a variety of moderating factors, such as race, ethnicity, and gender. Thus, among individuals with lower SES, members of further marginalized communities, such as racial and ethnic minorities and homeless individuals, experience greater alcohol-related consequences. Future studies are needed to more fully explore the underlying mechanisms of the relationship between SES and alcohol outcomes. This knowledge should be applied toward the development of multilevel interventions that address not only individual-level risks but also economic disparities that have precipitated and maintained a disproportionate level of alcohol-related consequences among more marginalized and vulnerable populations.;,citation_author=Susan E.

This study reports on feasibility and acceptability of ecological assessment of daily suicide risk-related outcomes (“daily diaries,” a special case of EMA) among adolescent inpatients in the critical post-discharge period. Thirty-four adolescents (76% female; ages 13–17) responded to daily electronic surveys for four weeks after discharge. Survey adherence was 69% (n = 650 days) and decreased each week. Adherence was half as likely among adolescents without attempt history (OR = 0.50, CI = 0.27–0.95). Mid- and end-point study responses indicated high acceptability of daily diaries. Most adolescents reported no change or more positive change in their thoughts/mood after daily surveys. Suicidal ideation was reported on 24.4% (n = 159) of the days. In the month post discharge, more teens reported suicidal thoughts using daily surveys (70.6%) compared to end-of-study assessment (45.2%) (Chi-square = 4.24, p = .039). Two participants (5.9%) reported an attempt. Ideation frequency and duration varied across time, suggesting utility of frequent assessments in this context.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reducing the Risk of Relapse;,citation_abstract=Any client who attempts to modify alcohol, tobacco, or drug use behavior faces the possibility of lapse or relapse. A lapse refers to the initial episode of use following a period of abstinence. A lapse may be quickly stopped by the client or it may lead to a relapse or continued use of a substance. How a client interprets and responds to a lapse plays a significant role in whether or not it leads to a relapse. The risk of lapse or relapse is highest in the first 3 months of recovery, when most relapses occur. Low motivation and poor participation in therapy or mutual support programs can raise the risk of relapse, even for clients who recently completed a residential or ambulatory treatment program. Other precipitants of relapse include psychiatric illness or an inability to cope with the challenges of recovery. Helping clients remain in therapy and identify and manage early relapse warning signs and high-risk situations are ways to lower the client’s risk of relapse.;,citation_author=Dennis C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol Use Disorder in Older Adults: Challenges in Assessment and Treatment;,citation_abstract=Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a common, under-recognized, and under-treated health concern in older adults. Its prevalence is expected to reach unprecedented levels as the U.S. population ages; consequently, it is poised to place a significant burden on the healthcare system. Given the growing body of evidence regarding the patterns of use in this age group and the serious consequences of its misuse, it is critical that nurses and other healthcare providers assess for AUD in order to identify older adults in need of treatment. Yet, differences in symptom presentation, problems in isolating the symptoms of AUD from other healthcare complaints associated with aging, as well as the denial and fear of stigma that is especially pervasive in this age group, are major barriers to its identification and subsequent treatment. Furthermore, the lack of consistent use of evidence-based, age-specific screening instruments to identify those at risk is another significant obstacle to successful treatment. Healthcare providers in primary care are especially well-positioned to perform a systematic assessment utilizing appropriate instruments to identify AUD and initiate age-specific interventions, including the use of alcohol screening and brief interventions (ASBIs). The use of ASBIs, along with other targeted interventions such as mutual help groups (MHGs), such as Alcoholics Anonymous, can be key in encouraging insight, dismantling denial, and supporting treatment success, lifelong recovery, and overall quality of life in this vulnerable group.;,citation_author=Mary C.

This study used measures of both proximal (e.g., behaviors) and distal (e.g., traits) risk factors that were predicted to relate to both an alcohol use disorder (AUD) and to treatment utilization among AUD-diagnosed men to test the hypothesis that both type of factors predict AUDs but only proximal factors influence treatment-seeking. Analyses of variance with contrasts were used to compare the means for risk factors between men with an AUD and AUD-free men and—given an AUD diagnosis—between men who were treated for an AUD and untreated men (n = 181). As predicted, men with AUDs differed on a broad range of proximal and distal factors, including number of alcohol problems, alcohol-related influences of peers and partners, alcohol expectancies, familial factors, and psychopathology. As hypothesized, only proximal risk factors predicted treatment-seeking among the AUD men, particularly alcohol problems and related consequences.;,citation_author=Alan Feingold;,citation_author=Deborah M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Psychometric properties of the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: This study introduces the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS), which has been used in several clinical trials at the University of Pennsylvania’s Treatment Research Center. The PACS is a five-item, self-report measure that includes questions about the frequency, intensity, and duration of craving, the ability to resist drinking, and asks for an overall rating of craving for alcohol for the previous week. Each question is scaled from 0 to 6. METHODS: To examine the questionnaire’s psychometric properties, we sampled responses from 147 individuals participating in a 9-month combined natrexone (100 mg/day)/psychotherapy trial. The psychotherapy consisted of weekly sessions of nurse-administered medication compliance and supportive treatment. RESULTS: The PACS proved to have excellent internal consistency. Predictive validity was demonstrated via a logistic regression analysis of craving during the 2nd week of the study on alcohol relapse during weeks 3-12 of the trial. Construct validity of the PACS was demonstrated via its convergence with two commonly used measures for assessing craving, the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale and the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire. Lack of correlation between PACS scores and several other noncraving, self-report measures indicates that the PACS also had good discriminant validity. Additional analyses revealed that there were significant differences in craving scores during the initial 3 weeks of the trial among those who did and those who did not relapse during weeks 3-12. CONCLUSION: The PACS is a reliable and valid measure of alcohol craving and can predict which individuals are at risk for subsequent relapse.;,citation_author=B A Flannery;,citation_author=J R Volpicelli;,citation_author=H M Pettinati;,citation_publication_date=1999-08;,citation_cover_date=1999-08;,citation_year=1999;,citation_issue=8;,citation_issn=0145-6008;,citation_pmid=10470970;,citation_volume=23;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Remission from substance use disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis;,citation_abstract=Objective This paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of available evidence on remission rates for substance use disorders (SUDs), providing weighted mean estimates of SUD remission rates. The review also explores study-level characteristics that may explain variations in remission rates across studies. Methods A comprehensive search strategy identified studies published between 2000 and 2015 with follow-up periods of at least three years or reported lifetime remission outcomes for potential inclusion in the review. Remission was defined as not meeting diagnostic criteria for abuse or dependence for a minimum period of six months, as of final follow-up. A single-group summary meta-analysis was performed. Pooled estimated annual remission rates (PEARRs) were calculated. Meta-regression techniques and subgroup analyses were used to explore the association between study remission rates and key selected variables. Results Of 8855 studies identified, 21 met the eligibility criteria. The results suggested that 35.0% to 54.4% of individuals with SUDs achieved remission, and this occurred after a mean follow-up period of 17 years. The PEARRs projected few cases of SUD remission, between 6.8% and 9.1% in any given year. Studies that reported higher remission rates had longer follow-up periods, and lower sample retention rates. Conclusions Results support the contention that SUDs are more likely to be “chronic” or long term disorders than acute disorders for a substantial number of individuals. However, more longitudinal research is required. Treatment geared to chronicity, such as assertive community treatment and intensive case management, needs to be more readily available for SUD populations.;,citation_author=M. -J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Gender Differences in Use of Alcohol Treatment Services and Reasons for Non-Use in a National Sample;,citation_abstract=Background: The majority of adults with alcohol use disorders do not obtain help, and women are less likely to utilize alcohol services than men. We sought to quantify gender differences in alcohol service utilization, overall and by type, using national longitudinal data and to explore potential gender differences in perceived need for help and reasons for not seeking help. Methods: We analyzed data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions from White, African American, and Hispanic adults (n=2,592) who met DSM-IV criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence at Wave 1 (2000–2001). We tested gender differences in Wave 2 (2004–2005) service utilization, perceived need for help, and treatment barriers using Rao-Scott chi-square tests and assessed predictors of outcomes in multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for problem severity, co-occurring disorders, and demographics. Results: Women had much lower odds than men of utilizing any alcohol service (aOR 0.53; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.86), specialty services (aOR 0.41; 95% CI 0.19, 0.87), and 12-step groups (aOR 0.39; 95% CI 0.21, 0.71). Perceived need for help among those who had not used any services was very low (5%), with no gender difference. Further, men and women reported equivalent numbers of treatment barriers and the same rank order for the most frequently endorsed barriers. However, women were twice as likely as men to think a problem would get better by itself—the most frequent reason for not seeking help (47% vs. 24%, p$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$.001), and men were more likely than women to report unsuccessful past help-seeking and not thinking anyone could help (19% vs. 3%, p$&amp;lt;$.001; and 17% vs. 5%, p$<$.001, respectively). Conclusions: Consistent with previous studies, women were less likely to utilize alcohol services than men. Future interventions should address low problem recognition, and tailoring to gender-specific barriers may help close the disparity in services utilization.;,citation_author=Paul A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=First-line Medications for the Outpatient Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder: A Systematic Review of Perceived Barriers;,citation_abstract=Objectives:&nbsp; Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a common illness with significant health and economic consequences. Although three pharmacotherapeutic agents have been shown to decrease heavy drinking days among individuals with AUD, they are vastly underutilized in clinical practice. The objective of this review was to elucidate barriers that may prevent patients from obtaining medication for addiction treatment (MAT) for AUD in an outpatient or residential setting. Methods:&nbsp; Electronic searches of Medline and EMBASE were conducted, and reference lists were hand-searched. All study designs which discussed the use of MAT for AUD in an outpatient or residential setting were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently screened the search output to identify potentially eligible articles, the full texts of which were retrieved and assessed for inclusion. Results:&nbsp; After eliminating duplicate citations and articles that did not meet eligibility criteria, 23 articles were included in the review. Perceived barriers to obtaining pharmacotherapy for the treatment of AUD in an outpatient or residential setting were grouped into 3 themes: lack of knowledge and concerns about efficacy and complexity of prescribing; treatment philosophy and stigma; medication accessibility including formulary restrictions, geographical and socioeconomic barriers. Conclusions:&nbsp; Although evidence-based pharmacotherapeutics have been approved for the treatment of AUD, our findings suggest patients continue to experience barriers to the use of these medications. Efforts should be made to increase rates of prescribing by providers and the use of medications by patients. More research is needed to further elucidate perceived barriers to MAT use, along with strategies to overcome them.;,citation_author=Caroline Gregory;,citation_author=Yelena Chorny;,citation_author=Shelley L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Modeling motivation for alcohol in humans using traditional and machine learning approaches;,citation_abstract=Given the significant cost of alcohol use disorder (AUD), identifying risk factors for alcohol seeking represents a research priority. Prominent addiction theories emphasize the role of motivation in the alcohol seeking process, which has largely been studied using preclinical models. In order to bridge the gap between preclinical and clinical studies, this study examined predictors of motivation for alcohol self-administration using a novel paradigm. Heavy drinkers (n = 67) completed an alcohol infusion consisting of an alcohol challenge (target breath alcohol = 60 mg%) and a progressive-ratio alcohol self-administration paradigm (maximum breath alcohol 120 mg%; ratio requirements range = 20–3 139 response). Growth curve modeling was used to predict breath alcohol trajectories during alcohol self-administration. K-means clustering was used to identify motivated (n = 41) and unmotivated (n = 26) self-administration trajectories. The data were analyzed using two approaches: a theory-driven test of a-priori predictors and a data-driven, machine learning model. In both approaches, steeper delay discounting, indicating a preference for smaller, sooner rewards, predicted motivated alcohol seeking. The data-driven approach further identified phasic alcohol craving as a predictor of motivated alcohol self-administration. Additional application of this model to AUD translational science and treatment development appear warranted.;,citation_author=Erica N. Grodin;,citation_author=Amanda K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Understanding and measuring psychological stress using social media;,citation_abstract=A body of literature has demonstrated that users’ mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, can be predicted from their social media language. There is still a gap in the scientific understanding of how psychological stress is expressed on social media. Stress is one of the primary underlying causes and correlates of chronic physical illnesses and mental health conditions. In this paper, we explore the language of psychological stress with a dataset of 601 social media users, who answered the Perceived Stress Scale questionnaire and also consented to share their Facebook and Twitter data. Firstly, we find that stressed users post about exhaustion, losing control, increased self-focus and physical pain as compared to posts about breakfast, family-time, and travel by users who are not stressed. Secondly, we find that Facebook language is more predictive of stress than Twitter language. Thirdly, we demonstrate how the language based models thus developed can be adapted and be scaled to measure county-level trends. Since county-level language is easily available on Twitter using the Streaming API, we explore multiple domain adaptation algorithms to adapt user-level Facebook models to Twitter language. We find that domain-adapted and scaled social media-based measurements of stress outperform sociodemographic variables (age, gender, race, education, and income), against ground-truth survey-based stress measurements, both at the user- and the county-level in the U.S. Twitter language that scores higher in stress is also predictive of poorer health, less access to facilities and lower socioeconomic status in counties. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of using social media as a new tool for monitoring stress levels of both individuals and counties.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A smartphone application to support recovery from alcoholism: A randomized controlled trial;,citation_abstract=Importance: Patients leaving treatment for alcohol-use disorders (AUDs) are not typically offered evidence-based continuing care, although research suggests that continuing care is associated with better outcomes. A smartphone-based application could provide effective continuing care. Objective: To determine whether patients leaving residential treatment for AUDs with a smartphone application to support recovery have fewer risky drinking days than control-group patients. Design: An un-blinded randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomized to treatment as usual or treatment as usual plus a smartphone with A-CHESS, an application designed to improve continuing care for AUDs. “A-CHESS” stands for Addiction – Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System. Setting: Three residential programs operated by one treatment organization in the Midwestern US and 2 residential programs operated by one organization in the Northeastern US. Participants: 349 patients who met the criteria for DSM-IV alcohol dependence when they entered residential treatment. 179 were randomized to the control group and 170 to the treatment group. Intervention: Treatment as usual varied across programs; none offered patients coordinated continuing care after discharge. A-CHESS provides monitoring, information, communication, and support services to patients, including ways for patients and counselors to stay in contact. The intervention lasted 8 months and the follow-up period lasted 4 months. Main Outcome Measure: Risky drinking days—the number of days during which a patient’s drinking in a 2-hour period exceeded, for men, 4 standard drinks and for women, 3 standard drinks. Patients were asked to report their risky drinking days in the previous 30 days on surveys taken 4, 8, and 12 months after discharge from residential treatment. Results: For the 8 months of the intervention and 4 months of follow-up, patients in the A-CHESS group reported significantly fewer risky drinking days than patients in the control group (M = 1.39 vs. 2.75, respectively; P = .003; 95% CI [.46, 2.27]).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Quitting Drugs: Quantitative and Qualitative Features;,citation_abstract=According to the idea that addiction is a chronic relapsing disease, remission is at most a temporary state. Either addicts never stop using drugs, or if they do stop, remission is short lived. However, research on remission reveals a more complex picture. In national epidemiological surveys that recruited representative drug users, remission rates varied widely and were markedly different for legal and illegal drugs and for different racial/ethnic groups. For instance, the half-life for cocaine dependence was four years, but for alcohol dependence it was 16 years, and although most dependent cocaine users remitted before age 30, about 5% remained heavy cocaine users well into their forties. Although varied, the remission results were orderly. An exponential growth curve closely approximated the cumulative frequency of remitting for different drugs and different ethnic/racial groups. Thus, each year a constant proportion of those still addicted remitted, independent of the number of years since the onset of dependence.;,citation_author=Gene M.

The study group consisted of 33 male alcohol-dependent persons, who participated in a treatment program. Clinical ratings were performed three times a week by a trained person during a visit to the clinic. The questionnaire contained 23 different items about irritation, craving for alcohol. sleep disturbances, etc. The relapses were either self-reported or detected by a biochemical marker in a urine sample that was taken daily. The most important factor for a relapse in alcohol drinking was shown to be if the patient already had had one relapse during the treatment. Other important clinical factors were the levels of irritation and autonomic disturbances. None of the variables measuring mood shifts was significant. Family conditions during childhood were the most important background variables. The predictions turned out to have a rather high specificity, but the sensitivity was lower. Half of the relapses were not predicted by an increased probability for relapse.

As a practitioner in the fields of hydraulics and measurement science, the author used statistical methods extensively in many environmental engineering and hydrological survey projects. The author strongly concurs in the need for statistics reform. This paper offers a practitioner’s perspective on statistics reform. In the author’s view, some statistical methods are good and should withstand statistics reform; some are bad and should be abandoned and removed from statistics textbooks and computer software packages. This paper focuses on two statistical methods derived from the t-distribution: the two-sample t-test and the t-interval method for measurement uncertainty calculation. We show why these two methods should be abandoned. We recommend using descriptive statistic analysis as an alternative to the two-sample t-test and an unbiased estimation method as an alternative to the t-interval method for measurement uncertainty calculation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relapse as a nonlinear dynamic system: Application to patients with alcohol use disorders;,citation_abstract=Understanding the relapse process is one of the most important issues in addictive behaviors research. To date, most studies have taken a linear approach toward predicting relapse based on risk factors. Nonlinear dynamical systems theory can be used to describe processes that are not adequately modeled using a linear approach. In particular, the authors propose that catastrophe theory, a subset of nonlinear dynamical systems theory, can be used to describe the relapse process in addictive behaviors. Two small prospective studies using 6-month follow-ups of patients with alcohol use disorders (inpatient, n=51; outpatient, n=43) illustrate how cusp catastrophe theory may be used to predict relapse. Results from these preliminary studies indicate that a cusp catastrophe model has more predictive utility than traditional linear models.

The present paper aims to further extend this model to incorporate social variables more fully. Methods The social-factors and alcohol-relapse literatures were reviewed within the framework of the reformulated relapse model. Results The literature review found that the number of social network members, investment of the individual in the social network, levels of general and alcohol-specific support available within the social network, and specific behaviors of network members all predict drinking outcomes. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which these social variables influence outcomes. The authors postulate that social variables influence outcomes by affecting intraindividual factors central to the reformulated relapse prevention model, including processes (e.g. self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, craving, motivation, negative affective states) and behaviors (e.g. coping and substance use.

To assess racial and ethnic differences in rates of completion from publicly funded alcohol treatment programs, and to estimate the extent to which any identified racial differences in completion rates are related to differences in patient characteristics. Data Sources. Administrative intake and discharge records from all publicly funded outpatient and residential alcohol treatment recovery programs in Los Angeles County (LAC) during 1998–2000. Study participants (N=10,591) are African American, Hispanic, and white patients discharged from these programs, ages 18 or older, who reported alcohol as their primary substance abuse problem. Study Design. Bivariate tests identified racial and ethnic differences in rates of treatment completion and patient characteristics. Logistic regression models assessed the contribution of differences in patient characteristics to differences in completion. Principal Findings. Significantly lower completion rates by African Americans (17.5 percent) relative to whites (26.7 percent) (odds ratio [OR]=0.58, 95 percent confidence interval [CI]: 0.50–0.68) are partially explained (40 percent) by differences in patient characteristics in outpatient care (adjusted OR=0.75, 95 percent CI: 0.63–0.90), mostly by indicators of economic resources (i.e., employment, homelessness, and Medi-Cal beneficiary). In residential care, only 7 percent of differences in completion (30.7 versus 46.1 percent) could be explained by the patient-level measures available (OR=0.52, 95 percent CI: 0.45–0.59; AOR=0.55, 95 percent CI: 0.47–0.65). Differences in completion rates between Hispanic and white patients were not detected. Conclusions. Large differences in rates of outpatient and residential alcohol treatment completion between African American and white patients at publicly funded programs in LAC, the nation’s second largest, publicly funded alcohol and drug treatment system, are partially because of economic differences among patients, but remain largely unexplained. These racial disparities merit additional investigation and the attention of health professionals.;,citation_author=Jerry O. Jacobson;,citation_author=Paul L. Robinson;,citation_author=Ricky N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using digital therapeutics to target gaps and failures in traditional mental health and addiction treatments;,citation_abstract=Mental health and substance use disorders are highly prevalent and are the leading cause of global disease burden worldwide. Nevertheless, most persons with mental health or substance use disorders do not receive care. Prominent barriers to traditional care include (1) stigma, (2) lack of culturally competent treatments, (3) prohibitively high cost and lack of insurance coverage, (4) inability to attend appointments due to transportation or available appointment times, and (5) inability to find coverage and prohibitively long wait times resulting from structural problems with an inadequate number of mental health providers. With the proliferation of the internet and mobile phones, digital therapeutics (software designed to prevent, treat, or manage a medical disorder or disease) are fundamentally able to address these issues.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using Smartphones to Improve Treatment Retention Among Impoverished Substance-Using Appalachian Women: A Naturalistic Study;,citation_abstract=Objectives: Longer retention in treatment is associated with positive outcomes. For women, who suffer worse drug-related problems than men, social technologies, which are more readily adopted by women, may offer promise. This naturalistic study examined whether a smartphone-based relapse-prevention system, A-CHESS (Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System), could improve retention for women with substance use disorders in an impoverished rural setting. Methods: A total of 98 women, age 18 to 40, in southeastern Kentucky and mandated to treatment, received A-CHESS with intensive outpatient treatment for 6 months. For comparison, data were obtained for a similar but non-equivalent group of 100 same-age women also mandated to treatment in the same clinics during the period. Electronic medical record data on length-of-stay and treatment service use for both groups were analyzed, with A-CHESS use data, to determine whether those using A-CHESS showed better retention than those without. Results: Women with A-CHESS averaged 780 service units compared with 343 for the comparison group. For those with discharge dates prior to the study’s end, A-CHESS patients stayed in treatment a mean of 410 vs 262 days for the comparison group. Conclusions: Given associations between retention and positive outcomes, mobile health technology such as A-CHESS may help improve outcomes among women, especially in settings where access to in-person services is difficult. The findings, based on a non-equivalent comparison, suggest the need for further exploration with rigorous experimental designs to determine whether and to what degree access to a smartphone with A-CHESS may extend and support recovery for women.;,citation_author=Darcie C Johnston;,citation_author=W David Mathews;,citation_author=Adam Maus;,citation_author=David H Gustafson;,citation_publication_date=2019-07;,citation_cover_date=2019-07;,citation_year=2019;,citation_doi=10.1177/1178221819861377;,citation_issn=1178-2218;,citation_pmid=31312084;,citation_volume=13;,citation_journal_title=Substance Abuse: Research and Treatment;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Compliance with ecological momentary assessment protocols in substance users: A meta-analysis;,citation_abstract=Background and Aims While there are considerable benefits to Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), poor compliance with assessment protocols has been identified as a limitation, particularly in substance users. Our aim was to identify the pooled compliance rate of EMA studies in substance users and examine variables that may influence compliance with EMA protocols, such as the length and frequency of assessments. Design A meta-analysis and meta-regression of all possible studies (randomized controlled trials and longitudinal) which incorporated EMA protocols, examining substance use. Setting Studies took place from 1998 to 2017, in numerous countries world-wide. Participants One hundred and twenty-six studies were identified, contributing a total of 19&nbsp;431 participants (52.32% male, mean age&nbsp;=&nbsp;28.86). Measurements Compliance data, the proportion of responses to the study protocol, were extracted from each study alongside prompt frequency, total length of assessment period, substance use population and device used to administer EMA prompts. Findings The pooled compliance rate across all studies was 75.06% [95% confidence interval (CI)&nbsp;=&nbsp;72.37%, 77.65%]. There was no evidence that compliance rates were significantly associated with prompt frequency [Q(3) = 7.35, P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.061], length of assessment period [Q(2) = 2.40, P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.301], substance type [Q(3) = 6.30, P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.098] or device administration [Q(4) = 4.28, P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.369].

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Is Marlatt’s relapse taxonomy reliable or valid?;,citation_abstract=The Relapse Replication and Extension Project (RREP) has failed to provide empirical support for Marlatt’s relapse taxonomy. Neither the reliability of the original Marlatt coding system nor its predictive or construct validity was supported by this group of studies. The present commentary explores a number of possible reasons for the generally negative outcomes. These findings should certainly lead to a re-evaluation of Marlatt’s relapse taxonomy and its operationalization. Nevertheless, despite the negative results, there are a number of reasons why the general Relapse Prevention concept is likely to survive in some form: it has been widely adopted and imitated clinically, key elements of the taxonomy are often focal points of treatment, and clinical research studies have repeatedly supported some elements of the taxonomy (e.g. negative emotional states, social pressure, interpersonal conflict, positive emotional states and temptations/urges). The RREP also evaluated some modifications of the original taxonomy as well as the use of more structured assessment instruments, and some of these provided more promising results. Further developments will need to take into account both research needs for greater precision, most likely through the use of more structured assessment instruments, and clinical needs for richness of detail and sensitivity to a wide variety of life circumstances.;,citation_author=Ronald M.

Our sample (N = 1376) included individuals of European (EA) and African (AA) ancestry from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) who were initially assessed as having AUD (DSM-5) and reassessed years later as either having AUD or in remission. To predict this difference in AUD recovery status, we analyzed the initial data using multimodal, multi-features machine learning applications including EEG source-level functional brain connectivity, Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS), medications, and demographic information. Sex and ancestry age-matched stratified analyses were performed with supervised linear Support Vector Machine application and were calculated twice, once when the ancestry was defined by self-report and once defined by genetic data. Multifeatured prediction models achieved higher accuracy scores than models based on a single domain and higher scores in male models when the ancestry was based on genetic data. The AA male group model with PRS, EEG functional connectivity, marital and employment status features achieved the highest accuracy of 86.04%. Several discriminative features were identified, including collections of PRS related to neuroticism, depression, aggression, years of education, and alcohol consumption phenotypes. Other discriminated features included being married, employed, medication, lower default mode network and fusiform connectivity, and higher insula connectivity.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mobile Apps for Mental Health Issues: Meta-Review of Meta-Analyses;,citation_abstract=Background: Mental health apps have great potential to help people needing support to cope with distress or specific symptoms. In fact, there is an exponential increase in the number of mental health apps available on the internet, with less than 5% being actually studied. Objective: This study aimed to assess the quality of the available evidence regarding the use of mental health apps and to summarize the results obtained so far. Methods: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were searched, specifically for mobile apps on mental health issues or symptoms, and rated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. Results: A total of 7 meta-analyses were carefully reviewed and rated. Although some meta-analyses looked at any mental health issue and analyzed the data together, these studies were of poorer quality and did not offer strong empirical support for the apps. Studies focusing specifically on anxiety symptoms or depressive symptoms were of moderate to high quality and generally had small to medium effect sizes. Similarly, the effects of apps on stress and quality of life tended to offer small to medium effects and were of moderate to high quality. Studies looking at stand-alone apps had smaller effect sizes but better empirical quality than studies looking at apps with guidance. The studies that included follow-ups mostly found a sustained impact of the app at an 11-week follow-up. Conclusions: This meta-review revealed that apps for anxiety and depression hold great promise with clear clinical advantages, either as stand-alone self-management or as adjunctive treatments.

This report highlights the number of American adults with SUDs in the past year and trends in SUDs between 2002 and 2014.&nbsp;Method:&nbsp;This report uses data from the 2002 to 2014 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health to examine trends in SUDs and receipt of treatment for substance use between 2002 and 2014.&nbsp;Results:&nbsp;Approximately 20.2 million adults aged 18 or older had a past year SUD. Of these adults, 16.3 million had an alcohol use disorder and 6.2 million had an illicit drug use disorder. An estimated 2.3 million adults had both an alcohol use disorder and an illicit drug use disorder in the past year. Of the adults with a past year SUD, 4 out of 5 had an alcohol use disorder, nearly 3 out of 10 had an illicit drug use disorder, and 1 out of 9 had both an alcohol use disorder and an illicit drug use disorder. The percentage of adults with a past year SUD in 2014 was similar to the percentages in 2010 to 2013 but was lower than the percentages in 2002 to 2009. Conclusion:&nbsp;Monitoring trends in SUDs gives public health providers opportunities to assess the scope of the issue in the United States and to plan substance abuse prevention and treatment programming. Most SUDs in the United States are related to alcohol use, and the long-term trends indicate that there has been a decrease in the prevalence of past year alcohol use disorders among adults.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The relationship between text message sentiment and self-reported depression;,citation_abstract=Background Personal sensing has shown promise for detecting behavioral correlates of depression, but there is little work examining personal sensing of cognitive and affective states. Digital language, particularly through personal text messages, is one source that can measure these markers. Methods We correlated privacy-preserving sentiment analysis of text messages with self-reported depression symptom severity. We enrolled 219&nbsp;U.S. adults in a 16 week longitudinal observational study. Participants installed a personal sensing app on their phones, which administered self-report PHQ-8 assessments of their depression severity, collected phone sensor data, and computed anonymized language sentiment scores from their text messages. We also trained machine learning models for predicting end-of-study self-reported depression status using on blocks of phone sensor and text features. Results In correlation analyses, we find that degrees of depression, emotional, and personal pronoun language categories correlate most strongly with self-reported depression, validating prior literature. Our classification models which predict binary depression status achieve a leave-one-out AUC of 0.72 when only considering text features and 0.76 when combining text with other networked smartphone sensors. Limitations Participants were recruited from a panel that over-represented women, caucasians, and individuals with self-reported depression at baseline. As language use differs across demographic factors, generalizability beyond this population may be limited. The study period also coincided with the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, which may have affected smartphone sensor data quality.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A unified approach to interpreting model predictions;,citation_abstract=Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction’s accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties.

Methods Participants were 185 PWID age 18–35 recruited from two sites of a large syringe service program in Chicago. After completing a baseline interview, participants used a mobile phone app to respond to momentary surveys on mood, substance use, and injection risk behavior for 15 days. Participants were assigned to receive surveys 4, 5, or 6 times per day. Results Participants were 68% male, 61% non-Hispanic white, 24% Hispanic, and 5% non-Hispanic Black. Out of 185 participants, 8% (n = 15) failed to complete any EMA assessments. Among 170 EMA responders, the mean number of days reporting was 10 (SD 4.7), the mean proportion of assessments completed was 0.43 (SD 0.27), and 76% (n = 130) completed the follow-up interview. In analyses adjusted for age and race/ethnicity, women were more responsive than men to the EMA surveys in days reporting (IRR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.13–1.56), and total number of surveys completed (IRR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.18–1.93).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relapse prevention: Maintenance strategies in the treatment of addictive behaviors, 2nd ed;,citation_abstract=In the two decades since the first edition of this book was published in 1985, much has happened in the relapse prevention (RP) field. Many of these new developments and areas of application are described in this new edition. This new edition differs from the original 1985 volume in several important ways. The first edition consisted of two main sections: Part I, which provided a general theoretical overview of the RP model and Part II, which contained four chapters describing application of RP with specific target behaviors (alcoholism, problem drinking, smoking, and weight management). The current edition contains chapters that extend the coverage of this approach to other addictive behaviors. Although abstinence is often the preferred goal for many substance use problems (e.g., quitting smoking), moderation is required for eating behavior and may be an alternative goal for other problems (e.g., moderate drinking or gambling). In the current text, RP methods are described for client goals that include both abstinence and harm reduction. The most important change for readers to note is that this new edition of the RP book is designed to be used in conjunction with the second edition of our companion volume, Assessment of Addictive Behaviors (Donovan &amp;amp;amp; Marlatt, 2005). The same authors were invited to provide both the assessment and RP chapters, so as to enhance congruence of coverage and cross-referenced materials.

Research conducted during the 1970s on determinants of relapse is briefly reviewed, beginning with a preliminary analysis of relapse patterns in alcoholics treated with aversion therapy. Theoretical foundations underlying the development of the taxonomy are then discussed with an emphasis on social-learning theory and its implications for cognitive-behavioral interventions for relapse prevention. Findings supporting the efficacy of coping-skills training for high-risk relapse situations, based on a prospective treatment outcome study for inpatient alcoholics, are also presented in support of the clinical validity of the relapse model. The paper concludes with a description of the refined and extended taxonomy of high-risk situations and the associated cognitive-behavioral model of relapse described in the Marlatt &amp;amp;amp; Gordon (1985) text on relapse prevention.;,citation_author=G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Health-related internet use among opioid treatment patients;,citation_abstract=The Internet and smartphones have become commonplace and can be effective in overcoming traditional barriers to accessing health information about substance use disorders (SUD), and their prevention or treatment. Little is known, however, about specific factors that may influence the use of these technologies among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations with SUDs. This study characterized the use of digital technologies and the Internet among individuals receiving treatment for opioid use disorder, focusing on identifying predictors of Internet use for health-related purposes. Participants came from an urban opioid replacement therapy program and completed a face-to-face survey on Internet and technology use. We examined the association between online health information seeking and technology acceptance variables, including perceived usefulness, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions (e.g., availability of devices/services and technical support). Participants (N = 178, ages 18–64) endorsed high rates of current smartphone ownership (94%) and everyday Internet use (67%). 88% of participants reported searching online for information about health or medical topics in the past 3 months. Predictors of Internet use for health-related purposes were higher technology acceptance for mobile Internet use, younger age, current employment, and less bodily pain. Our results demonstrate high acceptance and use of mobile technology and the Internet among this sample of socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals with SUDs.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Is psychology suffering from a replication crisis? What does “failure to replicate” really mean?;,citation_abstract=Psychology has recently been viewed as facing a replication crisis because efforts to replicate past study findings frequently do not show the same result. Often, the first study showed a statistically significant result but the replication does not. Questions then arise about whether the first study results were false positives, and whether the replication study correctly indicates that there is truly no effect after all. This article suggests these so-called failures to replicate may not be failures at all, but rather are the result of low statistical power in single replication studies, and the result of failure to appreciate the need for multiple replications in order to have enough power to identify true effects. We provide examples of these power problems and suggest some solutions using Bayesian statistics and meta-analysis. Although the need for multiple replication studies may frustrate those who would prefer quick answers to psychology’s alleged crisis, the large sample sizes typically needed to provide firm evidence will almost always require concerted efforts from multiple investigators. As a result, it remains to be seen how many of the recently claimed failures to replicate will be supported or instead may turn out to be artifacts of inadequate sample sizes and single study replications.

The following study aims to identify barriers to treatment of alcohol dependence, as perceived by individuals suffering from AUD, by means of through a systematic review. Material and methods: PubMed, Scopus and PsycINFO databases were searched for relevant publications the 27 th of February 2018. 492 articles where initially identified, of which 16 were eligible for inclusion in our analysis. The study quality was assessed using the Critical Appraised Skills program (CASP) checklist for qualitative studies, and the Checklist for systematics reviews (CFR) for quantitative studies. Results and discussion: This systematic review has investigated and identified barriers to treatment that vary greatly according to personal, cultural, institutional, ethnic and gender-specific factors. Three barriers proved to be prominent: Shame and stigma, lack of perception of treatment need and the paradox of both need for and fear of giving up drinking. Conclusion: A recommendation is to include in-depth questions about barriers in large national surveys. Additionally, to apple special considerations with regards to the aforementioned specific factors, when developing and offering treatment to subgroups with AUD.;,citation_author=Camilla May;,citation_author=Anette Søgaard Nielsen;,citation_author=Randi Bilberg;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=236083;,citation_doi=10.4303/jdar/236083;,citation_issn=2090-8334;,citation_volume=8;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Drug and Alcohol Research;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Preferences and Attitudes Towards Digital Communication and Symptom Reporting Methods in Clinical Trials;,citation_abstract=Purpose With the growing use of digital health technologies (DHT) in clinical trials, the opportunity to use technology to promote greater patient centricity and inclusivity has emerged. Current technology provides various mechanisms for communication, eg, through voice or text, however, participant familiarity and preference for them is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to understand participants’ communication preferences, their comfort with and use of messaging methods and their attitudes towards different communication and technology-driven symptom reporting methods in clinical trials. Participants and Methods Fifty-five participants, with any form of chronic health condition or recent intervention causing daily pain or discomfort were recruited by way of convenience sample for a single-centre, non-interventional, single-visit study, conducted in Ireland. Participants completed a questionnaire on communications preferences via an app on the participants’ own electronic device. Results In communication with friends and family, 69.6% of participants most preferred to use a messaging service. In communication with their healthcare provider, 72.7% preferred phone calls. Respondents preferred to communicate with friends/family via text messages (80.4%) over other methods. In clinical trial settings, participants are willing to use messaging methods to communicate with their physician. When reporting symptoms, most preferred a phone/video call to physicians (50.9%) and touch screen on device/smartphone (47.3%). 72.7% preferred to report symptoms using their own phone. Some respondents were interested in having the device read the questions/answers aloud (36.4%) and answer questions verbally (41.8%). Conclusion Participants were familiar with various communication methods but showed different preferences to communicate with friends and family versus healthcare professionals. For reporting symptoms in a clinical trial while at home, split results suggested a preference for independent reporting as well as live communication with physician, perhaps reflecting the rising use of telehealth. Further exploration is needed for the use of questions read aloud or answered verbally when reporting symptoms in a clinical trial.;,citation_author=Bryan McDowell;,citation_author=Kelly M Dumais;,citation_author=Sarah Tressel Gary;,citation_author=Ingeborg Gooijer;,citation_author=Tomás Ward;,citation_publication_date=2025-01;,citation_cover_date=2025-01;,citation_year=2025;,citation_doi=10.2147/PPA.S474535;,citation_issn=1177-889X;,citation_pmid=39901901;,citation_volume=19;,citation_journal_title=Patient preference and adherence;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Conceptual, methodological, and analytical issues in the study of relapse;,citation_abstract=This article examines conceptual, methodological, and analytic issues in research on relapse to alcohol and other drug use. The review notes the continued move in relapse research from a primary reliance on retrospective assessment of factors surrounding the onset of relapse episodes to an increased focus on the use of new technologies to obtain &amp;amp;amp;quot;near real time&amp;quot; data on proximal factors in relapses. Recent advances in neurobiology have yielded important gains in our understanding of vulnerability to relapse in alcohol and other drug abusers. New statistical techniques are also available to analyze data on relapse. From a theoretical standpoint, there has been an increasing appreciation for the complicated and dynamic interplay of distal and proximal factors in the relapse process. At this point, the strongest and most detailed data on factors in the onset and course of relapse have been generated by studies of smoking relapses that have made use of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) technology. However, there is still limited &quot;near real&quot; time data on proximal factors in alcohol and other drug relapses, and no such data on factors that influence the course of these relapses, once they have begun. Nevertheless, important methodological advances have been and continue to be made in the study of relapse, and our knowledge about the nature and process of relapse has increased considerably over the past 10 years.;,citation_author=James R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Efficacy and comparative effectiveness of telephone and smartphone remote continuing care interventions for alcohol use disorder: A randomized controlled trial;,citation_abstract=Background and Aims Management of alcohol use disorder (AUD) could be enhanced by effective remote treatments. This study tested whether supplementing intensive outpatient programs (IOPs) with continuing care delivered via (1) telephone, (2) smartphone or (3) their combination improves outcomes relative to (4) IOP only. Continuing care conditions were also compared. Design Randomized controlled trial of four groups with 3-, 6-, 9-, 12- and 18-month follow-ups. Setting University research center in Philadelphia, PA, USA. Participants Participants (n = 262) met DSM-V criteria for AUD, were largely male (71%) and African American (82%). Interventions and Comparator Telephone monitoring and counseling (TMC; n = 59), addiction comprehensive health enhancement support system (ACHESS; n = 68) and TMC + ACHESS (n = 70) provided for 12 months. The control condition received IOP only (TAU; n = 65). Measurement The primary outcome was percentage of days heavy drinking (PDHD) in months 1–12. Secondary outcomes were any drinking, any drug use, drinking consequences and quality of life. Findings Mean PDHD in months 1–12 was 10.29 in TAU, 5.41 in TMC, 6.80 in ACHESS and 5.99 in TMC + ACHESS. PDHD was lower in TMC [Cohen’s d = 0.35, P = 0.018, 95% confidence interval (CI) = (-1.42, -0.20)], ACHESS [d = 0.31, P = 0.031, 95% CI = (-1.27, -0.06)] and TMC + ACHESS [d = 0.36, P = 0.009, 95% CI = (-1.40, -0.20)] than in TAU. Differences between TMC + ACHESS, TMC and ACHESS were small (d $\leq$ 0.06) and non-significant. Findings were inconclusive as to whether or not the treatment conditions differed on PDHD at 18 months. A significant effect was obtained on any drinking, which was higher in months 1–12 in TAU than in TMC [odds ratio (OR) = 3.02, standard error (SE) = 0.43, 95% CI = (1.30, 6.99), P = 0.01] and TMC + ACHESS [OR = 2.43, SE = 0.39, 95% CI = (1.12, 5.27), P = 0.025). No other significant effects were obtained on other secondary outcomes during or after treatment.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Studies of factors in relapse to alcohol, drug and nicotine use: A critical review of methodologies and findings.;,citation_abstract=Objective: To critically review the methodologies used to study relapse in substance abusers and compare some of the findings these methodologies have produced. Method: Representative studies that have used retrospective, prospective, or near real time methodologies to study antecedents or consequences of relapse are presented and the strengths and weaknesses of each methodology are reviewed. Limitations in the ability of substance abusers to accurately report internal states are considered. Degree of convergence in findings across methodologies is examined. Results: Retrospective reports can provide perhaps the most detailed accounts of circumstances and experiences leading up to relapse, but are also more likely to be inaccurate due to the limitations of memory. Prospective studies are less likely to be affected by memory problems, but may not capture factors that immediately precede relapse. The near real time methodology, which uses palm-top computers to gather data, has many advantages over other methodologies, but a number of limitations as well. The two studies in which retrospective reports were directly compared to either prospective or near real time reports yielded mixed results regarding degree of agreement. Findings from several areas of research suggest that some substance abusers may have difficulty recognizing and reporting internal states. Conclusions: Despite memory problems and other limitations of self-report, all three methodologies have produced findings that implicate negative affect states, increased craving, cognitive factors, interpersonal problems, and lack of coping as factors in relapse. Future relapse studies should make use of all three methodologies to obtain data on relapse and consequences, and steps should be taken to enhance the accuracy of the self-reports that are gathered with each method.;,citation_author=J R McKay;,citation_publication_date=1999-07;,citation_cover_date=1999-07;,citation_year=1999;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.15288/jsa.1999.60.566;,citation_issn=0096-882X;,citation_volume=60;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Studies on Alcohol;,citation_publisher=Alcohol Research Documentation, Inc.;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Drug dependence, a chronic medical illness: Implications for treatment, insurance, and outcomes evaluation;,citation_abstract=The effects of drug dependence on social systems has helped shape the generally held view that drug dependence is primarily a social problem, not a health problem. In turn, medical approaches to prevention and treatment are lacking. We examined evidence that drug (including alcohol) dependence is a chronic medical illness. A literature review compared the diagnoses, heritability, etiology (genetic and environmental factors), pathophysiology, and response to treatments (adherence and relapse) of drug dependence vs type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma. Genetic heritability, personal choice, and environmental factors are comparably involved in the etiology and course of all of these disorders. Drug dependence produces significant and lasting changes in brain chemistry and function. Effective medications are available for treating nicotine, alcohol, and opiate dependence but not stimulant or marijuana dependence. Medication adherence and relapse rates are similar across these illnesses. Drug dependence generally has been treated as if it were an acute illness. Review results suggest that long-term care strategies of medication management and continued monitoring produce lasting benefits. Drug dependence should be insured, treated, and evaluated like other chronic illnesses. JAMA. 2000;284:1689-1695.;,citation_author=A. T. McLellan;,citation_author=D. C. Lewis;,citation_author=C. P.

METHOD: Findings from seven large multisite studies were combined to derive estimates of the average effectiveness of alcoholism treatment. To provide common outcome measures, conversion equations were used to compute variables not reported in the original studies. RESULTS: During the year after treatment, 1 in 4 clients remained continuously abstinent on average, and an additional 1 in 10 used alcohol moderately and without problems. During this period, mortality averaged less than 2%. The remaining clients, as a group, showed substantial improvement, abstaining on 3 days out of 4 and reducing their overall alcohol consumption by 87%, on average. Alcohol-related problems also decreased by 60%. CONCLUSIONS: About one third of clients remain asymptomatic during the year following a single treatment event. The remaining two thirds show, on average, large and significant decreases in drinking and related problems. This substantial level of improvement in &amp;amp;amp;quot;unremitted&amp;quot; clients tends to be overlooked when outcomes are dichotomized as successful or relapsed.;,citation_author=W. R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=What is a relapse? Fifty ways to leave the wagon;,citation_abstract=Binary thinking has often guided research and practice in the addiction field. For example, emphasis has been given to identifying whether an individual is ’alcoholic’ or not, and the dichotomous judgement that a client is either drinking or abstinent has been used to judge treatment effectiveness. Research on the nature of alcohol problems, however, indicates that they lie along several modestly interrelated continuous dimensions of severity, rather than occurring as a single syndrome qualitatively distinct from normality. Similarly, changes in addictive behaviors in general, and treatment outcomes in particular, are complex phenomena not readily captured by dichotomous classification. The term ’relapse’ is itself seriously problematic in various ways, and its definition elusive. It represents a somewhat arbitrary binary judgement imposed on the flow of behavior, and carries negative evaluative overtones. A potentially detrimental abstinence violation effect is implicit in the very use of the term ’relapse’, which thereby may become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Further, it implicitly pathologizes what is in fact a rather common event in the course of behavior change, and embodies an unrealistic and inaccurate conception of how successful change occurs over time. For these reasons, it may be useful in research and clinical practice to abandon the notion of ’relapse’ and focus instead on terminology that better describes the normal resolution process for addictive behaviors.;,citation_author=William R.

This study investigates the impact of SBDH, identified from both structured and unstructured data utilizing a natural language processing (NLP) system, on suicide prediction within 7, 30, 90, and 180 days of discharge. Using EHR data of 2,987,006 Veterans between October 1, 2009, and September 30, 2015, from the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA), we designed a case-control study that demonstrates that incorporating structured and NLP-extracted SBDH significantly enhances the performance of three architecturally distinct suicide predictive models - elastic-net logistic regression, random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron. For example, RF achieved notable improvements in suicide prediction within 180 days of discharge, with an increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 83.57&amp;amp;amp;amp;ndash;84.25% (95% CI&amp;amp;thinsp;=&amp;amp;thinsp;0.63%-0.98%, p-val&amp;amp;thinsp;&amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;thinsp;0.001) and the area under the precision recall curve from 57.38&amp;amp;ndash;59.87% (95% CI&amp;amp;thinsp;=&amp;amp;thinsp;3.86%-4.82%, p-val&amp;amp;thinsp;&amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;thinsp;0.001) after integrating NLP-extracted SBDH.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Implementation and workflow strategies for integrating digital therapeutics for alcohol use disorders into primary care: A qualitative study;,citation_abstract=Background: Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are prevalent and often go untreated. Patients are commonly screened for AUD in primary care, but existing treatment programs are failing to meet demand. Digital therapeutics include novel mobile app-based treatment approaches which may be cost-effective treatment options to help fill treatment gaps. The goal of this study was to identify implementation needs and workflow design considerations for integrating digital therapeutics for AUD into primary care. Methods: We conducted qualitative interviews with clinicians, care delivery leaders, and implementation staff (n = 16) in an integrated healthcare delivery system in the United States. All participants had experience implementing digital therapeutics for depression or substance use disorders in primary care. Interviews were designed to gain insights into adaptations needed to optimize existing clinical processes, workflows, and implementation strategies for use with alcohol-focused digital therapeutics. Interviews were recorded and transcribed and then analyzed using a rapid analysis process and affinity diagramming. Results: Qualitative themes were well represented across health system staff roles. Participants were enthusiastic about digital therapeutics for AUD, anticipated high patient demand for such a resource, and made suggestions for successful implementation. Key insights regarding the implementation of digital therapeutics for AUD and unhealthy alcohol use from our data include: (1) implementation strategy selection must be driven by digital therapeutic design and target population characteristics, (2) implementation strategies should seek to minimize burden on clinicians given the large numbers of patients with AUD who are likely to be interested in and eligible for digital therapeutics, and (3) digital therapeutics should be offered alongside many other treatment options to accommodate individual patients’ AUD severity and treatment goals. Participants also expressed confidence that previous implementation strategies used with other digital therapeutics such as clinician training, electronic health record supports, health coaching, and practice facilitation would be effective for the implementation of digital therapeutics for AUD. Conclusions: The implementation of digital therapeutics for AUD would benefit from careful consideration of the target population. Optimal integration requires tailoring workflows to meet anticipated patient volume and designing workflow and implementation strategies to meet the unique needs of patients with varying AUD severity.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Crowdsourcing a Word-Emotion Association Lexicon;,citation_abstract=Even though considerable attention has been given to the polarity of words (positive and negative) and the creation of large polarity lexicons, research in emotion analysis has had to rely on limited and small emotion lexicons. In this paper we show how the combined strength and wisdom of the crowds can be used to generate a large, high-quality, word-emotion and word-polarity association lexicon quickly and inexpensively. We enumerate the challenges in emotion annotation in a crowdsourcing scenario and propose solutions to address them. Most notably, in addition to questions about emotions associated with terms, we show how the inclusion of a word choice question can discourage malicious data entry, help identify instances where the annotator may not be familiar with the target term (allowing us to reject such annotations), and help obtain annotations at sense level (rather than at word level). We conducted experiments on how to formulate the emotion-annotation questions, and show that asking if a term is associated with an emotion leads to markedly higher inter-annotator agreement than that obtained by asking if a term evokes an emotion.;,citation_author=Saif M.

Personal sensing refers to collecting and analyzing data from sensors embedded in the context of daily life with the aim of identifying human behaviors, thoughts, feelings, and traits. This article provides a critical review of personal sensing research related to mental health, focused principally on smartphones, but also including studies of wearables, social media, and computers. We provide a layered, hierarchical model for translating raw sensor data into markers of behaviors and states related to mental health. Also discussed are research methods as well as challenges, including privacy and problems of dimensionality. Although personal sensing is still in its infancy, it holds great promise as a method for conducting mental health research and as a clinical tool for monitoring at-risk populations and providing the foundation for the next generation of mobile health (or mHealth) interventions.;,citation_author=David C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prospective Prediction of Lapses in Opioid Use Disorder: Protocol for a Personal Sensing Study;,citation_abstract=Background: Successful long-term recovery from opioid use disorder (OUD) requires continuous lapse risk monitoring and appropriate use and adaptation of recovery-supportive behaviors as lapse risk changes. Available treatments often fail to support long-term recovery by failing to account for the dynamic nature of long-term recovery. Objective: The aim of this protocol paper is to describe research that aims to develop a highly contextualized lapse risk prediction model that forecasts the ongoing probability of lapse. Methods: The participants will include 480 US adults in their first year of recovery from OUD. Participants will report lapses and provide data relevant to lapse risk for a year with a digital therapeutic smartphone app through both self-report and passive personal sensing methods (eg, cellular communications and geolocation). The lapse risk prediction model will be developed using contemporary rigorous machine learning methods that optimize prediction in new data.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predicting Relapse After Alcohol Use Disorder Treatment in a High-Risk Cohort: The Roles of Anhedonia and Smoking;,citation_abstract=On average, two-thirds of individuals treated for alcohol use disorder (AUD) relapse within six months. There is a critical need to identify modifiable risk factors associated with relapse that can be addressed during AUD treatment. Candidate factors include mood disorders and cigarette smoking, which frequently co-occur with AUD. We predicted that co-occurrence of mood disorders, cigarette smoking, and other modifiable conditions will predict relapse within six months of AUD treatment. Ninety-five Veterans, 23–91 years old, completed assessments of multiple characteristics including demographic information, co-occurring psychiatric disorders, and medical conditions during residential treatment for AUD. Participants’ alcohol consumption was monitored over six months after participation. Logistic regression was used to determine if, mood disorders, cigarette smoking status, alcohol consumption, educational level, and comorbid general medical conditions are associated with relapse after AUD treatment. Sixty-nine percent of Veterans (n = 66) relapsed within six months of study while 31% remained abstinent (n = 29). While education, comorbid general medical conditions, and mood disorder diagnoses were not predictors of relapse, Veterans with greater symptoms of anhedonia, active smokers, and fewer days of abstinence prior to treatment showed significantly greater odds for relapse within six months. Anhedonia and cigarette smoking are modifiable risk factors, and effective treatment of underlying anhedonic symptoms and implementation of smoking cessation concurrent with AUD-focused interventions may decrease risk of relapse.;,citation_author=Linh-Chi Nguyen;,citation_author=Timothy C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol use and the COVID-19 pandemic: Historical trends in drinking, contexts, and reasons for use among U.S. adults;,citation_abstract=Objective The current study used U.S. national data to examine drinking trends prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, focusing on changes in U.S. young- and middle-adult alcohol prevalence, frequency, and drinking contexts and reasons, and whether they differed by age and college status. Methods Data from 2015 to 2020 from 16,987 young adults (ages 19–30) and 23,584 middle adults (ages 35–55) in the national Monitoring the Future study were used to model historical trends and potential 2020 shifts (data collection April 1 to November 30, 2020) in prevalence (30-day, daily, binge drinking) and frequency (30-day, binge drinking). For young adults, data on drinking contexts and negative affect reasons for drinking were examined. Moderation by age and college status was also tested. Results 2020 was associated with (1) downward deviation in 30-day (young and middle adults) and binge drinking (young adults) prevalence; (2) upward deviation in daily drinking prevalence (middle adults); (3) among drinkers, upward deviation in frequency of 30-day (young and middle adults) and binge drinking (young adults); and (4) changes in drinking contexts and reasons among drinkers. Among college students, in particular, 2020 was associated with a downward deviation from expected historical trends in drinking prevalence. Upward deviations in daily prevalence and both binge and 30-day drinking frequency were stronger at ages 25–30 (vs. 19–24) and 35–45 (vs. 50–55). Conclusions Among U.S. young and middle adults, deviations from expected historical trends in population alcohol use that occurred during the pandemic included decreases in alcohol use prevalence, increases in alcohol use frequency, and increases in the use of alcohol to relax/relieve tension and because of boredom. These shifts were likely due, in part, to drinking while alone and at home—which increased during the pandemic.;,citation_author=Megan E. Patrick;,citation_author=Yvonne M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Acceptability of digital health interventions: Embracing the complexity;,citation_abstract=Acceptability is a core concept in digital health. Available frameworks have not clearly articulated why and how researchers, practitioners and policy makers may wish to study the concept of acceptability. Here, we aim to discuss (i) the ways in which acceptability might differ from closely related concepts, including user engagement; (ii) the utility of the concept of acceptability in digital health research and practice; (iii) social and cultural norms that influence acceptability; and (iv) pragmatic means of measuring acceptability, within and beyond the research process. Our intention is not to offer solutions to these open questions but to initiate a debate within the digital health community. We conducted a narrative review of theoretical and empirical examples from the literature. First, we argue that acceptability may usefully be considered an emergent property of a complex, adaptive system of interacting components (e.g., affective attitude, beliefs), which in turn influences (and is influenced by) user engagement. Second, acceptability is important due to its ability to predict and explain key outcomes of interest, including user engagement and intervention effectiveness. Third, precisely what people find acceptable is deeply contextualized and interlinked with prevailing social and cultural norms. Understanding and designing for such norms (e.g., through drawing on principles of user centered design) is therefore key. Finally, there is a lack of standard acceptability measures and thresholds. Star ratings coupled with free-text responses may provide a pragmatic means of capturing acceptability. Acceptability is a multifaceted concept, which may usefully be studied with a complexity science lens.;,citation_author=Olga Perski;,citation_author=Camille E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Digital Health Interventions for Delivery of Mental Health Care: Systematic and Comprehensive Meta-Review;,citation_abstract=Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted mental health care delivery to digital platforms, videoconferencing, and other mobile communications. However, existing reviews of digital health interventions are narrow in scope and focus on a limited number of&nbsp;mental health conditions. Objective: To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive systematic meta-review of the literature to assess the state of digital health interventions for the treatment of mental health conditions. Methods: We searched MEDLINE for secondary literature published between 2010 and 2021 on the use, efficacy, and appropriateness of digital health interventions for the delivery of mental health care. Results: Of the 3022 records identified, 466 proceeded to full-text review and 304 met the criteria for inclusion in this study. A majority (52%) of research involved the treatment of substance use disorders, 29% focused on mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders, and &amp;amp;amp;gt;5% for each remaining mental health conditions. Synchronous and asynchronous communication, computerized therapy, and cognitive training appear to be effective but require further examination in understudied mental health conditions. Similarly, virtual reality, mobile apps, social media platforms, and web-based forums are novel technologies that have the potential to improve mental health but require higher quality evidence. Conclusions: Digital health interventions offer promise in the treatment of mental health conditions. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital health interventions provide a safer alternative to face-to-face treatment. However, further research on the applications of digital interventions in understudied mental health conditions is needed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in psychiatric patients and student controls: A real-world feasibility study;,citation_abstract=Background Smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a promising methodology for mental health research. The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of smartphone-based active and passive EMA in psychiatric outpatients and student controls. Methods Two smartphone applications —MEmind and eB2— were developed for behavioral active and passive monitoring. The applications were tested in psychiatric patients with a history of suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors (STB), psychiatric patients without a history of STB, and student controls. Main outcome was feasibility, measured as response to recruitment, retention, and EMA compliance. Secondary outcomes were patterns of smartphone usage. Results Response rate was 87.3% in patients with a history of STB, 85.1% in patients without a history of STB, and 75.0% in student controls. 457 participants installed the MEmind app (120 patients with a history of STB and 337 controls) and 1,708 installed the eB2 app (139 patients with a history of STB, 1,224 patients with no history of STB and 346 controls). For the MEmind app, participants were followed-up for a median of 49.5, resulting in 22,622 person-days. For the eB2 application, participants were followed-up for a median of 48.9 days, resulting in 83,521 person-days. EMA compliance rate was 65.00% in suicidal patients and 75.21% in student controls. At the end of the follow-up, over 60% of participants remained in the study. Limitations Cases and controls were not matched by age and sex. Cases were patients who were receiving adequate psychopharmacological treatment and attending their appointments, which may result in an overstatement of clinical compliance. Conclusions Smartphone-based active and passive monitoring are feasible methods in psychiatric patients in real-world settings. The development of applications with friendly interfaces and directly useful features can help increase engagement without using incentives. The MEmind and eB2 applications are promising clinical tools that could contribute to the management of mental disorders.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using machine learning to predict heavy drinking during outpatient alcohol treatment;,citation_abstract=Background Accurate clinical prediction supports the effective treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and other psychiatric disorders. Traditional statistical techniques have identified patient characteristics associated with treatment outcomes. However, less work has focused on systematically leveraging these associations to create optimal predictive models. The current study demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict clinical outcomes in people completing outpatient AUD treatment. Method We used data from the COMBINE multisite clinical trial (n = 1383) to develop and test predictive models. We identified three priority prediction targets, including (1) heavy drinking during the first month of treatment, (2) heavy drinking during the last month of treatment, and (3) heavy drinking between weekly/bi-weekly sessions. Models were generated using the random forest algorithm. We used “leave sites out” partitioning to externally validate the models in trial sites that were not included in the model training. Stratified model development was used to test for sex differences in the relative importance of predictive features. Results Models predicting heavy alcohol use during the first and last months of treatment showed internal cross-validation area under the curve (AUC) scores ranging from 0.67 to 0.74. AUC was comparable in the external validation using data from held-out sites (AUC range = 0.69 to 0.72). The model predicting between-session heavy drinking showed strong classification accuracy in internal cross-validation (AUC = 0.89) and external test samples (AUC range = 0.80 to 0.87). Stratified analyses showed substantial sex differences in optimal feature sets. Conclusion Machine learning techniques can predict alcohol treatment outcomes using routinely collected clinical data. This technique has the potential to greatly improve clinical prediction accuracy without requiring expensive or invasive assessment methods.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Lapse, Relapse, and Chasing the Wagon: Post-Treatment Drinking and Recovery;,citation_abstract=This study examines relapse and recovery in Project MATCH. The study examines the transitions between periods of abstinence, lapse, and relapse. A set of proximal and distal variables were hypothesized to predict the likelihood of a transition to a different state over time using a semi-Markov model. The distal variables were stable predictors of relapse including severity of addiction, drug use, and psychiatric severity. The proximal predictors, which varied over time, included anger, symptoms of depression, action, struggling with maintenance, temptation, confidence, and social support. The study examined drinking outcomes of 469 individuals post-treatment and found that confidence to abstain and action orientation increased the probability of abstinence, and decreased the probability of lapsed and relapsed drinking. Confidence and endorsing action stage behaviors and attitudes were associated with the abstinence violation effect. The constructs of temptation and struggling with maintenance acted as risk factors for higher levels of drinking. Depression had mixed effects and appeared to be related to lapsed drinking more than relapsed drinking. Alcohol involvement acted as a risk factor for relapsed drinking. Information about the individuals drinking history was also examined. The number of prior episodes in abstinence or drinking states increased the probability of returning to the same types of abstinent or drinking behaviors. The length of each episode less frequently was significantly related to the transitions, However when significant, longer periods of abstinence and relapsed drinking were associated with less likely return to the same behaviors. Of particular note was that a history of relapsed drinking made lapsed drinking less likely, and a history of lapsed drinking made relapsed drinking less likely. This pattern supports the underlying division of drinking behaviors into the two categories of lapse and relapse. This study demonstrated that novel statistical methods such as Semi-Markov models can be used to investigate questions which could not be addressed or effectively answered with more commonly used methods. The semi-Markov models of transitions between drinking states helped to explain the complexity of the road to recovery.;,citation_author=Daniel Brett Rounsaville;,citation_publication_date=2010;,citation_cover_date=2010;,citation_year=2010;,citation_isbn=9781124454702;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_dissertation_institution=University of Maryland, Baltimore County;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Perceived Barriers to Treatment for Alcohol Problems: A Latent Class Analysis;,citation_abstract=Objective: Low rates of alcohol treatment seeking have been shown to be associated with perceived barriers to treatment, but heterogeneity in patterns of perceived barriers has not been explored. The study analyzed data from a population-based sample of adults with alcohol abuse and dependence in order to describe latent classes of individuals who reported one or more of 15 perceived barriers to seeking alcohol treatment and to identify characteristics associated with class membership. Methods: Data were from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (2001–2002). Analyses were restricted to treatment-naive adults with alcohol abuse or dependence who reported a perceived treatment need (N=1,053). Latent class analysis was performed to identify subgroups with respect to barriers to treatment. Latent class regression identified variables associated with each subgroup. Results: Two subgroups emerged: the low-barriers class (87%), characterized primarily by attitudinal barriers, and the high-barriers class (13%), characterized by significant attitudinal, financial, stigma, and readiness-for-change barriers. In both classes, the most frequently endorsed barrier was the attitudinal belief that “I should be strong enough” to handle the problem without treatment. Univariate analyses showed strong associations between membership in the high-barriers class and comorbid psychiatric disorders, alcohol dependence (compared with abuse), and a family history of alcohol problems. Multivariate analyses found significant associations with a lifetime anxiety disorder and with education level. Conclusions: Attitudinal barriers were most prevalent. Findings revealed a notable subgroup with multiple barriers, including financial and stigma-related barriers. This subgroup may require additional resources and support to enter treatment.;,citation_author=Megan S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pathways in the relapse–treatment–recovery cycle over 3 years;,citation_abstract=For many individuals, substance use leads to a chronic cycle of relapse, treatment reentry, and recovery, often lasting for decades. This study replicates earlier work, documents the transition patterns within the cycle during a 3-year period, and identifies variables that predict these transitions. Data are from 1,326 adults recruited from sequential admissions to 12 substance abuse treatment facilities in Chicago, IL, between 1996 and 1998. Participants were predominantly female (60%) and African American (88%) adults. Participants were interviewed at intake, and at 6, 24, and 36 months post-intake follow-up rates ranged from 94% to 98% per wave. At each observation, participants’ current status in the cycle was classified as (1) in the community using, (2) incarcerated, (3) in treatment, or (4) in the community not using. The transitional probabilities and correlates of pathways between these states were estimated. Over 83% of the participants transitioned from one point in the cycle to another during the 3 years (including 36% two times, 14% three times). For the people in the community, about half remained in the same status (either using or abstinent) and just under half transitioned. The majority of people whose beginning status was incarceration or in-treatment also transitioned by the end of the observation period. While there was some overlap, predictors typically varied by pathway and direction (e.g., using to not using vs. not using to using). These results help demonstrate the need to adopt a chronic vs. acute care model for substance use. While exploratory and observational, several of the predictors are time-dependent and identify promising targets for interventions designed to shorten the cycle and increase the long-term effectiveness of treatment.;,citation_author=Christy K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Modeling Complexity of EMA Data: Time-Varying Lagged Effects of Negative Affect on Smoking Urges for Subgroups of Nicotine Addiction;,citation_abstract=Introduction: Ecological momentary assessments (EMA) are increasingly used in studies of smoking behavior. Through EMA, examination of lagged relationships is particularly useful for establishing a temporal order of events and for identifying types and timing of risk factors. The time-varying effect model (TVEM) handles EMA data challenges and addresses unique questions about the time-varying effects. Methods: Generalized TVEM was applied to EMA data from a smoking cessation study to investigate a “time-varying lagged” effect of negative affect on high smoking urges. Participants included 224 smokers with a smoking history of 23.1 years (SD = 9.8) smoking 27.3 cigarettes per day (SD = 10.7), which provided 11,394 EMAs following a quit attempt and prior to a smoking lapse. Results: The effect of negative affect was found to vary as a function of a time lag, with stronger immediate effects: estimated odds ratio (OR) of 2.7 for the lower nicotine-dependence group (time to first morning cigarette $&amp;amp;amp;gt;$ 5min, 57.6%) and OR of 2.4 for the higher nicotine-dependence group ($\leq$ 5min). The magnitude of the effect persisted up to 7hr while decreasing over time. Conclusions: This analysis confirmed the importance of negative affect as a precursor of smoking urges while showing that the magnitude of the effect varies over time. An assumption of a constant lagged effect may bias estimates of the relationships and fail to provide a comprehensive outlook of the relational dynamics.;,citation_author=Mariya Shiyko;,citation_author=Pamela Naab;,citation_author=Saul Shiffman;,citation_author=Runze Li;,citation_publication_date=2014-05;,citation_cover_date=2014-05;,citation_year=2014;,citation_issue=Suppl 2;,citation_doi=10.1093/ntr/ntt109;,citation_issn=1462-2203;,citation_pmid=23911846;,citation_volume=16;,citation_journal_title=Nicotine &amp;amp; Tobacco Research;">

Psychologists can improve research practices to advance knowledge in ways that improve replicability.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identifying Gender from SMS Text Messages;,citation_abstract=Short message service (SMS) has become a very popular medium for communication due to its convenience and low cost. SMS text messaging makes it easy to provide a false name, age, gender, and location in order to hide one’s true identity. Consequently it has become important to establish new cyber forensics methods, such as detecting SMS message authors, as a post-hoc analysis technique deemed useful in criminal persecution cases. In this paper, we propose a new combined method for authorship classification of gender of SMS text messages, which combines machine learning algorithms with text processing features to increase the prediction accuracy of the author gender classification.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predictive validity of Marlatt’s relapse taxonomy versus a more general relapse code;,citation_abstract=Marlatt’s system for classifying relapses involves integrating information about the context of a relapse into a judgment about the most critical aspects of the situation. Constraints in this taxonomy, however, may limit its validity. On a sample of 300 subjects drawn from six treatment facilities, we compared the predictive validity of Marlatt’s taxonomy with that of a coding scheme with fewer constraints. Marlatt’s taxonomy does not significantly predict drinking outcome, nor does it predict time to relapse. There is weak evidence, however, that under some circumstances Marlatt’s taxonomy can predict the type of relapse subsequently observed. The alternative coding system also does not seem useful for predicting drinking outcome, although a possible association was found between internal attribution and time to return to heavy drinking. The alternative system does seem to be able to detect repetitive aspects of subsequent relapse situations; lack of social interactions, family setting, anxiety and depression were most likely to repeat. It may be useful to consider these relapse attributes in treatment planning. The minimal predictive validity for both the Marlatt and the alternative relapse code may be due to weaknesses in the relatively unstructured interview used to gather the data, or to failure to assess the most critical dimensions relating to subsequent relapse.;,citation_author=Robert L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine learning vs addiction therapists: A pilot study predicting alcohol dependence treatment outcome from patient data in behavior therapy with adjunctive medication;,citation_abstract=Background and objectives Clinical staff providing addiction treatment predict patient outcome poorly. Prognoses based on linear statistics are rarely replicated. Addiction is a complex non-linear behavior. Incorporating non-linear models, Machine Learning (ML) has successfully predicted treatment outcome when applied in other areas of medicine. Using identical assessment data across the two groups, this study compares the accuracy of ML models versus clinical staff to predict alcohol dependence treatment outcome in behavior therapy using patient data only. Methods Machine learning models (n = 28) were constructed (“trained”) using demographic and psychometric assessment data from 780 previously treated patients who had undertaken a 12 week, abstinence-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy program for alcohol dependence. Independent predictions applying assessment data for an additional 50 consecutive patients were obtained from 10 experienced addiction therapists and the 28 trained ML models. The predictive accuracy of the ML models and the addiction therapists was then compared with further investigation of the 10 best models selected by cross-validated accuracy on the training-set. Variables selected as important for prediction by staff and the most accurate ML model were examined. Results The most accurate ML model (Fuzzy Unordered Rule Induction Algorithm, 74%) was significantly more accurate than the four least accurate clinical staff (51%–40%). However, the robustness of this finding may be limited by the moderate area under the receiver operator curve (AUC = 0.49). There was no significant difference in mean aggregate predictive accuracy between 10 clinical staff (56.1%) and the 28 best models (58.57%). Addiction therapists favoured demographic and consumption variables compared with the ML model using more questionnaire subscales. Conclusions The majority of staff and ML models were not more accurate than suggested by chance. However, the best performing prediction models may provide useful adjunctive information to standard clinically available prognostic data to more effectively target treatment approaches in clinical settings.;,citation_author=Martyn Symons;,citation_author=Gerald F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predicting alcohol dependence treatment outcomes: A prospective comparative study of clinical psychologists versus “trained” machine learning models;,citation_abstract=Background and aims Clinical staff are typically poor at predicting alcohol dependence treatment outcomes. Machine learning (ML) offers the potential to model complex clinical data more effectively. This study tested the predictive accuracy of ML algorithms demonstrated to be effective in predicting alcohol dependence outcomes, compared with clinical judgement and traditional linear regression. Design Prospective study. ML models were trained on 1016 previously treated patients (training-set) who attended a hospital-based alcohol and drug clinic. ML models (n = 27), clinical psychologists (n = 10) and a “traditional” logistic regression model (n = 1) predicted treatment outcome during the initial treatment session of an alcohol dependence programme. Setting A 12-week cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-based abstinence programme for alcohol dependence in a hospital-based alcohol and drug clinic in Australia. Participants Prospective predictions were made for 220 new patients (test-set; 70.91% male, mean age = 35.78 years, standard deviation = 9.19). Sixty-nine (31.36%) patients successfully completed treatment. Measurements Treatment success was the primary outcome variable. The cross-validated training-set accuracy of ML models was used to determine optimal parameters for selecting models for prospective prediction. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operator curve (AUC), Brier score and calibration curves were calculated and compared across predictions. Findings The mean aggregate accuracy of the ML models (63.06%) was higher than the mean accuracy of psychologist predictions (56.36%). The most accurate ML model achieved 70% accuracy, as did logistic regression. Both were more accurate than psychologists (P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.05) and had superior calibration. The high specificity for the selected ML (79%) and logistic regression (90%) meant they were significantly (P $&amp;lt;$ 0.001) more effective than psychologists (50%) at correctly identifying patients whose treatment was unsuccessful. For ML and logistic regression, high specificity came at the expense of sensitivity (26 and 31%, respectively), resulting in poor prediction of successful patients. Conclusions Machine learning models and logistic regression appear to be more accurate than psychologists at predicting treatment outcomes in an abstinence programme for alcohol dependence, but sensitivity is low.;,citation_author=Martyn Symons;,citation_author=Gerald F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Validation of an alcohol misuse classifier in hospitalized patients;,citation_abstract=Background Current modes of identifying alcohol misuse in hospitalized patients rely on self-report questionnaires and diagnostic codes that have limitations, including low sensitivity. Information in the clinical notes of the electronic health record (EHR) may further augment the identification of alcohol misuse. Natural language processing (NLP) with supervised machine learning has been successful at analyzing clinical notes and identifying cases of alcohol misuse in trauma patients. METHODS: An alcohol misuse NLP classifier, previously developed on trauma patients who completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, was validated in a cohort of 1000 hospitalized patients at a large, tertiary health system between January 1, 2007 and September 1, 2017. The clinical notes were processed using the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) guidelines for alcohol misuse were used during annotation of the medical records in our validation dataset. RESULTS: The alcohol misuse classifier had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 (95% CI 0.90–0.93) in the cohort of hospitalized patients. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.88 (95% CI 0.85–0.90), 0.78 (95% CI 0.74–0.82), 0.85 (95% CI 0.82–0.87), and 0.82 (95% CI 0.78–0.86), respectively. The Hosmer–Lemeshow Test (p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.13) demonstrates good model fit. Additionally, there was a dose-dependent response in alcohol consumption behaviors across increasing strata of predicted probabilities for alcohol misuse. CONCLUSION: The alcohol misuse NLP classifier had good discrimination and test characteristics in hospitalized patients. An approach using the clinical notes with NLP and supervised machine learning may better identify alcohol misuse cases than conventional methods solely relying on billing diagnostic codes.;,citation_author=Daniel To;,citation_author=Brihat Sharma;,citation_author=Niranjan Karnik;,citation_author=Cara Joyce;,citation_author=Dmitriy Dligach;,citation_author=Majid Afshar;,citation_publication_date=2020-05;,citation_cover_date=2020-05;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.alcohol.2019.09.008;,citation_issn=0741-8329;,citation_volume=84;,citation_journal_title=Alcohol;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Experienced Burden of and Adherence to Smartphone-Based Ecological Momentary Assessment in Persons with Affective Disorders;,citation_abstract=(1) Background: The use of smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) questionnaires in affective disorder research has rapidly increased. Though, a thorough understanding of experienced burden of and adherence to EMA is crucial in determining the usefulness of EMA. (2) Methods: Persons with current affective disorders (n = 100), remitted persons (n = 190), and healthy controls (n = 94) participated in a smartphone-based EMA two-week monitoring period. Our primary outcomes were (momentary) perceived burden of and adherence to EMA. (3) Results: In the whole sample, lower positive and higher negative affect were associated with slightly higher levels of perceived momentary burden (B = -0.23 [95%CI = -0.27–0.19], B = 0.30 [95%CI = 0.24–0.37], respectively). The persons with current affective disorders reported slightly higher levels of experienced momentary burden (Mdn = 1.98 [IQR = 1.28–2.57]), than the remitted persons (Mdn = 1.64 [IQR = 1.11–2.24]) and healthy controls (Mdn = 1.28 [IQR = 1.04–1.92]). Nevertheless, the persons with current affective disorders still showed very high adherence rates (Mdn = 94.3% [IQR = 87.9–97.1]), at rates on a par with the remitted persons (Mdn = 94.3% [IQR = 90.0–97.1]) and healthy controls (Mdn = 94.3% [IQR = 90.0–98.6]). (4) Discussion: Frequent momentary questionnaires of mental well-being are slightly more burdensome to the persons with current affective disorders, but this does not seem to have a negative impact on adherence. Their high rate of adherence to EMA—which was similar to that in remitted persons and healthy controls —suggests that it is feasible to apply (short-duration) EMA.;,citation_author=Claire R.

Multivariate models were fit for 3 barriers to seeking help (structural, attitudinal, and readiness for change) for either alcohol or drug problems, controlling for socio-demographic characteristics and problem severity. Predicted probabilities were generated to evaluate gender differences by racial/ethnic subgroups. Over three quarters of the samples endorsed attitudinal barriers related to either alcohol or drug use. Generally, women were less likely to endorse attitudinal barriers for alcohol problems. African Americans and Latina/os were less likely than Whites to endorse attitudinal barriers for alcohol problems, Latina/os were less likely than Whites to endorse readiness for change barriers for alcohol and drug problems, however, African Americans were more likely to endorse structural barriers for alcohol problems. Comparisons within racial/ethnic subgroups by gender revealed more complex findings, although across all racial/ethnic groups women endorsed attitudinal barriers for alcohol problems more than men.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Automated-detection of risky alcohol use prior to surgery using natural language processing;,citation_abstract=Background Preoperative risky alcohol use is one of the most common surgical risk factors. Accurate and early identification of risky alcohol use could enhance surgical safety. Artificial Intelligence-based approaches, such as natural language processing (NLP), provide an innovative method to identify alcohol-related risks from patients’ electronic health records (EHR) before surgery. Methods Clinical notes (n = 53,629) from pre-operative patients in a tertiary care facility were analyzed for evidence of risky alcohol use and alcohol use disorder. One hundred of these records were reviewed by experts and labeled for comparison. A rule-based NLP model was built, and we assessed the clinical notes for the entire population. Additionally, we assessed each record for the presence or absence of alcohol-related International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes as an additional comparator. Results NLP correctly identified 87% of the human-labeled patients classified with risky alcohol use. In contrast, diagnosis codes alone correctly identified only 29% of these patients. In terms of specificity, NLP correctly identified 84% of the non-risky cohort, while diagnosis codes correctly identified 90% of this cohort. In the analysis of the full dataset, the NLP-based approach identified three times more patients with risky alcohol use than ICD codes. Conclusions NLP, an artificial intelligence-based approach, efficiently and accurately identifies alcohol-related risk in patients’ EHRs. This approach could supplement other alcohol screening tools to identify patients in need of intervention, treatment, and/or postoperative withdrawal prophylaxis. Alcohol-related ICD diagnosis had limited utility relative to NLP, which extracts richer information within clinical notes to classify patients.;,citation_author=V. G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol Consumption, Dependence, and Treatment Barriers: Perceptions Among Nontreatment Seekers with Alcohol Dependence;,citation_abstract=Background: Alcohol use disorders are highly prevalent worldwide. However, only a minority with alcohol dependence seek and undergo treatment. From a public health perspective, it is important to understand why people do not seek treatment. Objectives: This study aims to describe how people with alcohol dependence perceive and discuss treatment for alcohol use disorders and their reasons for seeking and not seeking treatment. Methods: 32 alcohol dependent adults from the general population participated in focus groups and individual interviews in Stockholm during 2011–2012. Data were analyzed with thematic content analysis. Results: Suffering from alcohol dependence, as well as realizing the need for, and entering treatment, were associated with shame and stigma, and were strong barriers to treatment. Other barriers included the desire to deal with alcohol problems on one’s own and the view that seeking treatment required total abstinence. Negative health-effects were mainly a nonissue. The participants’ knowledge about treatment options was limited to lifelong abstinence, medication with Disulfiram and residential treatment. These were seen as unappealing and contrasted sharply with preferred treatment. Conclusions/Importance: Public health literacy regarding alcohol use, dependence, and treatment ought to be improved in order to lower barriers to treatment. Treatment services need to better match the needs and wishes of potential service users, as well as taking stigmatization into account. In order to develop suitable treatments, and to reach the majority who do not seek treatment, the clinical understanding of alcohol dependence needs to be expanded to include mild to moderate dependence.;,citation_author=Sara Wallhed Finn;,citation_author=Ann-Sofie Bakshi;,citation_author=Sven Andréasson;,citation_publication_date=2014-05;,citation_cover_date=2014-05;,citation_year=2014;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.3109/10826084.2014.891616;,citation_issn=1082-6084;,citation_pmid=24601784;,citation_volume=49;,citation_journal_title=Substance Use &amp;amp;amp; Misuse;,citation_publisher=Taylor &amp;amp; Francis;">

The online version of this article has been corrected.] Psychology is in a replication crisis that has brought about a period of self-reflection and reform. Yet, this reform appears in many ways to focus primarily on methodological and statistical practices, with little consideration for the foundational issues that concern many theoretical and philosophical psychologists and that may provide a richer account of the crisis. In this article, we offer an overview of the history of the replication crisis, the critiques and reforms at the heart of the crisis, and several points of intersection between the reform movement and broader theoretical and philosophical issues. We argue that the problems of the replication crisis and the concerns of the reform movement in fact provide various points of entry for theoretical and philosophical psychologists to collaborate with reformers in providing a more deeply philosophical critique and reform.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Modeling the complexity of post-treatment drinking: It’s a rocky road to relapse;,citation_abstract=The most widely cited road block to successful treatment outcomes for psychological and substance use disorders has been described as the return to the previous behavior, or “relapse.” The operational definition of “relapse” varies from study to study and between clinicians, but in general the term is used to indicate the return to previous levels of symptomatic behavior. One explanation for the variation in the operationalization of relapse is the wide variety of behaviors for which the term is applied, including (but not limited to): depression, substance abuse, schizophrenia, mania, sexual offending, risky sexual behavior, dieting, and the anxiety disorders. A second explanation for the multitude of definitions for relapse is the inherent complexity in the process of behavior change. In this paper we present the most recent treatment outcome research evaluating relapse rates, with a special focus on the substance use disorders. Following this review of the literature we present an argument for the operationalization of relapse as a dynamic process, which can be empirically characterized using dynamical systems theory. We support this argument by presenting results from the analysis of alcohol treatment outcomes using catastrophe modeling techniques. These results demonstrate the utility of catastrophe theory in modeling the alcohol relapse process. The implications of these analyses for the treatment of alcohol use disorders, as well as a discussion of future research incorporating nonlinear dynamical systems theory is provided.;,citation_author=Katie Witkiewitz;,citation_author=G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predictors of heavy drinking during and following treatment;,citation_abstract=Alcohol dependence has been described as a relapsing condition and it has been proposed that alcohol lapses could potentially be explained by dynamic associations between contextual, interpersonal, and intrapersonal risk factors. Yet, few studies have tested the associations between risk factors in the prediction of lapse dynamics. The current study was a secondary analysis of data from the COMBINE study (n = 1,383; COMBINE Study Research Group, 2003). The goal of the current study was to examine static (alcohol dependence severity, treatment history, marital status, psychiatric symptoms) and dynamic (negative affect, craving, stress) predictors of heavy drinking during the course of treatment and up to one year following treatment. Results from dynamic latent difference score models indicated that higher levels of static and dynamic risk and increased dynamic risk over time were significantly associated with greater increases in heavy drinking. Likewise, more frequent heavy drinking and higher static risk predicted higher levels of dynamic risk. In addition, changes in dynamic risk factors significantly mediated the association between changes in heavy drinking and both psychiatric symptoms and treatment history. It is important to note that while the effects of static and dynamic risk factors in the prediction of heavy drinking were statistically significant, the magnitude of the effects were small. The current study provided partial support for a dynamic model of relapse; however future research using intensive longitudinal data collection and more advanced statistical techniques could further elucidate lapse dynamics and potentially improve relapse prevention planning.;,citation_author=Katie Witkiewitz;,citation_publication_date=2011-09;,citation_cover_date=2011-09;,citation_year=2011;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1037/a0022889;,citation_issn=1939-1501;,citation_pmid=21480681;,citation_volume=25;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Psychology of Addictive Behaviors;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relapse prevention for alcohol and drug problems: That was zen, this is tao;,citation_abstract=Relapse prevention, based on the cognitive-behavioral model of relapse, has become an adjunct to the treatment of numerous psychological problems, including (but not limited to) substance abuse, depression, sexual offending, and schizophrenia. This article provides an overview of the efficacy and effectiveness of relapse prevention in the treatment of addictive disorders, an update on recent empirical support for the elements of the cognitive-behavioral model of relapse, and a review of the criticisms of relapse prevention. In response to the criticisms, a reconceptualized cognitive-behavioral model of relapse that focuses on the dynamic interactions between multiple risk factors and situational determinants is proposed. Empirical support for this reconceptualization of relapse, the future of relapse prevention, and the limitations of the new model are discussed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Acceptability of Personal Sensing Among People With Alcohol Use Disorder: Observational Study;,citation_abstract=Background: Personal sensing may improve digital therapeutics for mental health care by facilitating early screening, symptom monitoring, risk prediction, and personalized adaptive interventions. However, further development and the use of personal sensing requires a better understanding of its acceptability to people targeted for these applications. Objective: We aimed to assess the acceptability of active and passive personal sensing methods in a sample of people with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder using both behavioral and self-report measures. This sample was recruited as part of a larger grant-funded project to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict lapses. Methods: Participants (N=154; n=77, 50% female; mean age 41, SD 11.9 years; n=134, 87% White and n=150, 97% non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1-8 weeks of abstinence) were recruited to participate in a 3-month longitudinal study. Participants were modestly compensated for engaging with active (eg, ecological momentary assessment [EMA], audio check-in, and sleep quality) and passive (eg, geolocation, cellular communication logs, and SMS text message content) sensing methods that were selected to tap into constructs from the Relapse Prevention model by Marlatt. We assessed 3 behavioral indicators of acceptability: participants’ choices about their participation in the study at various stages in the procedure, their choice to opt in to provide data for each sensing method, and their adherence to a subset of the active methods (EMA and audio check-in). We also assessed 3 self-report measures of acceptability (interference, dislike, and willingness to use for 1 year) for each method. Results: Of the 192 eligible individuals screened, 191 consented to personal sensing. Most of these individuals (169/191, 88.5%) also returned 1 week later to formally enroll, and 154 participated through the first month follow-up visit. All participants in our analysis sample opted in to provide data for EMA, sleep quality, geolocation, and cellular communication logs. Out of 154 participants, 1 (0.6%) did not provide SMS text message content and 3 (1.9%) did not provide any audio check-ins. The average adherence rate for the 4 times daily EMA was .80. The adherence rate for the daily audio check-in was .54. Aggregate participant ratings indicated that all personal sensing methods were significantly more acceptable (all P&amp;amp;amp;lt;.001) compared with neutral across subjective measures of interference, dislike, and willingness to use for 1 year. Participants did not significantly differ in their dislike of active methods compared with passive methods (P=.23). However, participants reported a higher willingness to use passive (vs active) methods for 1 year (P=.04). Conclusions: These results suggest that active and passive sensing methods are acceptable for people with alcohol use disorder over a longer period than has previously been assessed. Important individual differences were observed across people and methods, indicating opportunities for future improvement.;,citation_author=Kendra Wyant;,citation_author=Hannah Moshontz;,citation_author=Stephanie B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine learning models for temporally precise lapse prediction in alcohol use disorder;,citation_abstract=We developed three machine learning models that predict hour-by-hour probabilities of a future lapse back to alcohol use with increasing temporal precision (i.e., lapses in the next week, next day, and next hour). Model features were based on raw scores and longitudinal change in theoretically implicated risk factors collected through ecological momentary assessment. Participants (N = 151, 51% male, Mage = 41, 87% White, 97% non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1–8 weeks of abstinence) from alcohol use disorder provided 4  daily ecological momentary assessment for up to 3 months. We used grouped, nested cross-validation to select the best models and evaluate the performance of those best models. Models yielded median areas under the receiver operating curves of 0.89, 0.90, and 0.93 in the 30 held-out test sets for week-, day-, and hour-level models, respectively. Some feature categories consistently emerged as being globally important to lapse prediction across our week-, day-, and hour-level models (i.e., past use, future self-efficacy). However, most of the more punctate, time-varying constructs (e.g., craving, past stressful events, arousal) appear to have a greater impact within the next-hour prediction model. This research represents an important step toward the development of a smart (machine learning guided) sensing system that can both identify periods of peak lapse risk and recommend specific supports to address factors contributing to this risk.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Differences in Perceptions of and Practices Regarding Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorders Among VA Primary Care Providers in Urban and Rural Clinics;,citation_abstract=Background Effective behavioral and pharmacological treatments are available and recommended for patients with alcohol use disorders (AUD) but rarely received. Barriers to receipt and provision of evidence-based AUD treatments delivered by specialists may be greatest in rural areas. Methods A targeted subanalysis of qualitative interview data collected from primary care providers at 5 Veterans Affairs clinics was conducted to identify differences in provider perceptions and practices regarding AUD treatment across urban and rural clinics. Key contacts were used to recruit 24 providers from 3 “urban” clinics at medical centers and 2 “rural” community-based outpatient clinics. Providers completed 30-minute semistructured interviews, which were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results Thirteen urban and 11 rural providers participated. Urban and rural providers differed regarding referral practices and in perceptions of availability and utility of specialty addictions treatment. Urban providers described referral to specialty treatment as standard practice, while rural providers reported substantial barriers to specialty care access and infrequent specialty care referral. Urban providers viewed specialty addictions treatment as accessible and comprehensive, and perceived addictions providers as “experts” and collaborators, whereas rural providers perceived inadequate support from the health care system for AUD treatment. Urban providers desired greater integration with specialty addictions care while rural providers wanted access to local addictions treatment resources. Conclusions Providers in rural settings view referral to specialty addictions treatment as impractical and resources inadequate to treat AUD. Additional work is needed to understand the unique needs of rural clinics and decrease barriers to AUD treatment.;,citation_author=Jessica P. Young;,citation_author=Carol E.

        <p>Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing disease. An automated recovery support system powered by personal sensing and machine learning may assist with the inherently difficult task of identifying when and why an individual is at increased risk for lapse. Cellular communication sensing may be one promising method for detecting dynamic changes in lapse risk. Moreover, these communications can be contextualized with self-reported, risk-relevant information about the contact. In this study, we evaluated the performance of a machine learning model that predicts the probability of next-day alcohol lapse among individuals (N = 144) in early recovery from AUD using contextualized cellular communication data and baseline demographic and AUD characteristics. The best-performing model used an elastic net algorithm and retained 13 features. The median posterior auROC for the best model was 0.68, with a relatively narrow 95% Bayesian confidence interval (CI; [0.64, 0.71]) that did not include 0.5. We also evaluated a comparison model to assess the incremental predictive value of cellular communication features beyond baseline measures. The baseline model retained five features and achieved performance nearly identical to that of the full model (median auROC = 0.68, 95% CI [0.64, 0.71]). These results indicate that cellular communication data capture some risk-relevant signal for alcohol lapse; however, they do not provide incremental predictive value beyond a baseline model that included only demographic and self-report measures. Several communication features were retained in the final model with moderately sized coefficients, suggesting that aspects of social communication may be important for understanding lapse risk. Nonetheless, limitations inherent to cellular communication as a sensing method may outweigh their added value.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing disease <span class="citation" data-cites="mclellanDrugDependenceChronic2000 dennisManagingAddictionChronic2007 rounsavilleLapseRelapseChasing2010">(<a href="#ref-dennisManagingAddictionChronic2007" role="doc-biblioref">Dennis &amp; Scott, 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-mclellanDrugDependenceChronic2000" role="doc-biblioref">McLellan et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#ref-rounsavilleLapseRelapseChasing2010" role="doc-biblioref">Rounsaville, 2010</a>)</span>. Lapses, single episodes of alcohol use, are among the strongest predictors (and a necessary precursor) for relapse, a full return to harmful drinking <span class="citation" data-cites="marlattRelapsePreventionMaintenance1985 marlattRelapsePreventionSecond2007">(<a href="#ref-marlattRelapsePreventionSecond2007" role="doc-biblioref">Marlatt &amp; Donovan, 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-marlattRelapsePreventionMaintenance1985" role="doc-biblioref">Marlatt &amp; Gordon, 1985</a>)</span>. While lapses can occur at any point in recovery, they are particularly risky during early recovery <span class="citation" data-cites="daleyReducingRiskRelapse2019">(<a href="#ref-daleyReducingRiskRelapse2019" role="doc-biblioref">Daley &amp; Douaihy, 2019</a>)</span>. Protective coping mechanisms and socio-environmental resources that support recovery are dynamic and accumulate over time <span class="citation" data-cites="clevelandRecoveryRecoveryCapital2021">(<a href="#ref-clevelandRecoveryRecoveryCapital2021" role="doc-biblioref">Cleveland et al., 2021</a>)</span>. As a result, early recovery represents a critical window of vulnerability during which a lapse is more likely to escalate into relapse.</p>
<p>An automated recovery support system powered by personal sensing and machine learning may assist with the inherently difficult task of identifying when and why someone is at increased risk for lapse. Personal sensing of densely sampled data from individuals’ day-to-day lives can provide the inputs necessary for temporally dynamic lapse predictions <span class="citation" data-cites="mohrPersonalSensingUnderstanding2017">(<a href="#ref-mohrPersonalSensingUnderstanding2017" role="doc-biblioref">Mohr et al., 2017</a>)</span>. Early machine learning models using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data have achieved excellent accuracy in predicting future lapses back to alcohol use in treatment seeking populations <span class="citation" data-cites="chihPredictiveModelingAddiction2014 wyantMachineLearningModels2024 wyantForecastingRiskAlcoholunderreview">(<a href="#ref-chihPredictiveModelingAddiction2014" role="doc-biblioref">Chih et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-wyantMachineLearningModels2024" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al., 2024</a>, <a href="#ref-wyantForecastingRiskAlcoholunderreview" role="doc-biblioref">under review</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Despite the high predictive success of EMA, questions remain about the long-term feasibility of a self-report sensing method. EMA has been shown to be well-tolerated among substance use populations over relatively short periods of time <span class="citation" data-cites="jonesComplianceEcologicalMomentary2019 wyantAcceptabilityPersonalSensing2023">(<a href="#ref-jonesComplianceEcologicalMomentary2019" role="doc-biblioref">Jones et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-wyantAcceptabilityPersonalSensing2023" role="doc-biblioref">Wyant et al., 2023</a>)</span>. It is unclear whether individuals would be willing and able to adhere to an extensive EMA protocol (e.g., 4 prompts per day) indefinitely. Moreover, EMA items are chosen using domain expertise from decades of research on the self-report factors that predict lapse. It is possible, however, that there are several alternative precipitators of lapse not yet discovered due to small subtle changes in one’s environment, social circle, or lifestyle that cannot be easily pinpointed in self-report.</p>
<p>Cellular communication sensing may be a promising alternative to EMA. Whereas EMA is limited to, at most, several assessments per day, communication sensing is mostly passive and can be monitored moment-by-moment. Cellular communication patterns also appear to capture clear, risk-relevant constructs. Late-night phone calls could indicate an emergency, “drunk dialing,” or interpersonal conflict. A decrease in the number of contacts an individual communicates with could reflect a shrinking social circle, isolation, or disengagement.</p>
<p>These data may become even more powerful when communication patterns are contextualized with participant-specific meaning. For instance, knowing a participant’s relationship to their contacts, whether they have previously drank alcohol with a given contact, or whether that contact supports their recovery goals could substantially alter interpretation. In the examples above, contextualized communication data might reveal that late-night calls are made to a sponsor, or that a shrinking social circle reflects reduced contact with individuals unsupportive of their recovery. In this way, the same communication patterns may reflect protective processes rather than increased lapse risk.</p>
<p>In this study, we assessed whether contextualized cellular communication features contain clinically meaningful signals for predicting next-day alcohol lapse risk among individuals in early recovery from AUD. Using a machine learning model, we evaluated the predictive utility of these features and identified the most important communication features, with the goal of uncovering new, clinically meaningful predictors of lapse risk.</p>

<h1>Methods</h1>
<section id="participants-and-procedure" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="participants-and-procedure">Participants and Procedure</h2>
<p>We recruited adults in early recovery from AUD in Madison, Wisconsin, through print and digital advertisements and partnerships with treatment centers. Eligibility criteria required that participants were age 18 or older, able to read and write in English, had moderate to severe AUD <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, had a goal of abstinence from alcohol, had been abstinent for 1–8 weeks, were willing to use a single smartphone, and were not exhibiting severe psychosis or paranoia.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Participants completed up to 5 study visits over approximately 3 months: a screening visit, intake visit, and 3 monthly follow-up visits. At screening we collected demographic information (age, sex at birth, race, ethnicity, education, marital status, employment, and income) and clinical characteristics (DSM-5 AUD symptom count, alcohol problems <span class="citation" data-cites="hurlbutAssessingAlcoholProblems1992">(<a href="#ref-hurlbutAssessingAlcoholProblems1992" role="doc-biblioref">Hurlbut &amp; Sher, 1992</a>)</span>, and presence of psychological symptoms <span class="citation" data-cites="derogatislBriefSymptomInventory">(<a href="#ref-derogatislBriefSymptomInventory" role="doc-biblioref">Derogatis, L.R., 2000</a>)</span>). At intake we collected additional self-report data on abstinence self-efficacy <span class="citation" data-cites="mckiernanDevelopmentBriefAbstinence2011">(<a href="#ref-mckiernanDevelopmentBriefAbstinence2011" role="doc-biblioref">McKiernan et al., 2011</a>)</span>, craving <span class="citation" data-cites="flanneryPsychometricPropertiesPenn1999">(<a href="#ref-flanneryPsychometricPropertiesPenn1999" role="doc-biblioref">Flannery et al., 1999</a>)</span>, and recent recovery efforts.</p>
<p>At each monthly follow-up, we downloaded backups of participants’ cellular communication metadata directly from their smartphones. Metadata included the phone number of the other party, the date and time of the communication, the origin of call or message (i.e., incoming or outgoing), whether the call was answered (voice calls only), and the duration of the call (voice calls only). During each follow-up visit, study staff identified important contacts. Contacts that participants communicated with at least twice by call or text in the past month were deemed important. For each important contact, participants answered 7 contextual questions about their type of relationship, whether they ever drank alcohol with this person, the drinking status of the contact, expectations about whether the contact would drink in their presence, recovery status of contact, level of supportiveness of contact, and affective experiences with the contact.</p>
<p>While enrolled, participants completed 4 brief daily ecological momentary assessments (7-10 questions). The first item assessed alcohol use (date and time of any unreported drinking episodes). Lapse reports were verified at follow-up visits using a timeline follow-back interview. Additional sensing data streams and self-report measures were collected for the parent grant. The full study protocol is available on our Open Science Framework page (<a href="https://osf.io/wgpz9/">https://osf.io/wgpz9/</a>).</p>

<section id="data-analysis-plan" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-analysis-plan">Data Analysis Plan</h2>
<p>Our models predicted the probability of an alcohol lapse within a 24-hour window. Predictions were generated daily at 4 a.m., beginning on participants’ second study day and continuing for up to 3 months. Participants reported the date and hour of the start and end time of any alcohol use on the first item of the EMA. Prediction windows were labeled as lapse if any alcohol use was reported in the 24-hour window. In total, there were 11,507 labeled prediction windows across all participants. Positive lapse labels were underrepresented (7.5%; 861/11,507).</p>
<p>We filtered the data to include only communications with known context (i.e., people with whom they communicated with at least twice in a month and whom they provided self-report context about). Cellular communication features were engineered from all available data up to the start of each window. We used six scoring epochs (6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours before the start of the prediction window) to create features. Within each scoring epoch we calculated two types of features: raw and difference features. Raw features represent the raw feature value calculated within a scoring epoch (e.g., the rate count of text messages during the 48 hours immediately preceding the start of the prediction window). Difference features capture participant-level changes from their baseline scores. Specifically, we subtracted each participant’s mean score for each feature (using all available data prior to the prediction window) from the associated raw feature (e.g., the participant’s average rate count of text messages across all time on study subtracted from the rate count in the preceding 48 hours).</p>
<p>The full model included 406 features from cellular communication data plus 24 numeric or dummy-coded features from baseline self-report measures. We also evaluated a comparison model that used only the baseline features. <a href="#tbl-1" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;1</a> details the raw predictors, feature engineering procedures, and features included in the full vs.&nbsp;baseline models. Other feature engineering steps performed during cross-validation included imputing missing values (median imputation for numeric features and mode imputation for nominal features) and removing zero and near-zero variance features as determined from held-in data.</p>
<!--I dont think I understand context enough from the text and table either.  We need to know how it was collected and on who (only frequent contacts).   We then need to know that numbers are linked to these contacts so you can count them but that the features that dont use context are for all contacts, regardless if they are a frequent person-->
<!--KW: I tried to make this more clear in procedure section and this section. Let me know if it does not come through. We filtered out data from unknown contacts prior to feature engineering so those logs are not included even in generic features-->
<p>Candidate model configurations differed by algorithm (elastic net, random forest, XGBoost), outcome resampling method, and hyperparameter values. The best configuration for each model was selected using 6 repeats of participant-grouped 5-fold cross-validation. Our performance metric was area under the receiver operating curve (auROC). Folds were stratified so that all folds contained comparable proportions of individuals who lapsed frequently (i.e., 10+ times).</p>
<p>We evaluated model performance with a Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model. Posterior distributions with 95% credible intervals (CI) were estimated from the 30 held-out test sets using weakly informative, data-dependent priors to regularize and reduce overfitting.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Random intercepts were included for repeat and fold (nested within repeat). auROCs were logit-transformed and regressed on model type to estimate the probability that model performances differed systematically.</p>
<p>Our best performing models used an elastic net algorithm. We quantified feature importance by examining the retained features (i.e., coefficient value &gt; 0) in the full model and ordering them by absolute coefficient value. These values provide an estimate of the direction and magnitude of association between each predictor and the outcome, conditional on the other features retained. All our annotated analysis scripts are publicly available on our study website (<a href="https://jjcurtin.github.io/study_messages/">https://jjcurtin.github.io/study_messages/</a>).</p>

<p>We screened 192 participants. Of these, 169 enrolled and 154 completed the first follow-up visit. Data from 1 participant was excluded due to not reporting a goal of abstinence and lapsing multiple times a day every day on study. Data from 1 participant was excluded due to evidence of careless responding. Data from 1 participant was excluded due to poor compliance with EMA resulting in questionable lapse labels. Data from 7 participants were excluded due to poor compliance providing communication data (i.e., deleting logs prior to download and/or not providing context information about important contacts). The final analytic sample included 144 participants. <a href="#tbl-2" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;2</a> provides the demographic characterization of our sample. 56% of participants reported at least one lapse while on study.</p>

<p>Participants had an average of 26 important contacts (range 2-113) that were contextualized with self-report information. We obtained a total of 375,912 contextualized communications across participants. Participants had, on average, 2,610 contextualized communications (range = 109-14,225) averaging to about 33 communications per day (range 3-278).</p>

<p>The median posterior auROC for the full model was 0.68, with relatively narrow 95% CI ([0.64, 0.71]) that did not contain .5. This provides strong evidence that the model is capturing signal in the data. The final model retained 13 features (<a href="#fig-1" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>). The top four were baseline measures of abstinence confidence, having a goal of abstinence, abstinence self-efficacy when experiencing negative affect, and craving. Communication frequency with people unaware of the individual’s recovery goals also emerged as an important feature associated with increased lapse risk.</p>
<p>We evaluated a comparison model to assess the incremental predictive value of cellular communication features beyond baseline measures. The baseline model retained 5 features and achieved performance nearly identical to the full model (median auROC = 0.68, 95% CI [0.64, 0.71]). The median difference in auROC between the full and baseline models was less than .01, providing no evidence (52% probability) that the full model performed better than the baseline model. <!--I think this is the probasbilityh that the full model performed better than the baseline model.  Bit surprised that its even .52 given how close they auROCs are. Are you sure about that?--> <!--KW: yes you are right I updated the wording. As far as probability being .52 this is accurate. .50 would mean its essentially a coin flip for which model performs better (i.e., they pretty much perform the same) so .52 seems expected to me.  If probability was 0 that would actually mean the baseline model was performing better than the full model--></p>

<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>Our model achieved fair performance, with an auROC of 0.68, indicating that some predictive signal was present. However, it did not offer incremental value beyond a baseline model that included only demographic and self-report measures. Consistent with this, the four most important predictors in our model were all self-report variables: abstinence confidence, abstinence goal, negative affect efficacy, and craving.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, several communication features were retained in the final model with moderately sized coefficients. These included communications with people unaware of the participant’s recovery status, non-drinkers, friends, and individuals who were unpleasant to interact with. In contrast, raw counts of calls and text messages and call durations were not retained in the final model. This implies that the quantity of communication may be less informative than the quality and social significance. Future research may benefit from collecting richer contextual data about communication contacts to better understand the social dynamics contributing to lapse risk.</p>
<p>Even with highly contextualized communication data, however, prediction may be limited by data sparsity. Many participants had few daily communications, and some had extended periods with no recorded interactions at all. Our study design may have further contributed to this limitation. We collected only phone and SMS text communications through the native smartphone app. In recent years, many individuals use private messaging apps (e.g., WhatsApp, Signal) or social media platforms (e.g., Facebook Messenger, Instagram) as their primary communication method <span class="citation" data-cites="mcdowellPreferencesAttitudesDigital2025">(<a href="#ref-mcdowellPreferencesAttitudesDigital2025" role="doc-biblioref">McDowell et al., 2025</a>)</span>. Therefore, our dataset likely missed a substantial portion of participants’ communications. Notably, the communication features that were retained in the final model were scored over the longest scoring epochs (72 and 168 hours), suggesting that when more data are available (i.e., more communications) these features may be become more important.<!--KW: John, I added this sentence but let me know if you think it needs more explanation or doesn't fit here.--> Future studies could explore whether increasing communication data from these alternative platforms yield stronger predictive signals.</p>
<p>We cannot entirely dismiss the potential value of cellular communication data for risk prediction. For example, researchers have successfully incorporated communication data into models with other sensing data (e.g., accelerometer, geolocation, and device usage) to detect current <span class="citation" data-cites="baeDetectingDrinkingEpisodes2017">(<a href="#ref-baeDetectingDrinkingEpisodes2017" role="doc-biblioref">S. Bae et al., 2017</a>)</span> and predict future <span class="citation" data-cites="baeLeveragingMobilePhone2023">(<a href="#ref-baeLeveragingMobilePhone2023" role="doc-biblioref">S. W. Bae et al., 2023</a>)</span> heavy drinking episondes in non-treatment seeking young adult populations. It is possible, that in certain populations cellular communications may hold more signal. Young adults may have more frequent communications reducing sparsity concerns. Additionally, non-treatment seeking populations may be less likely to sensor their data (i.e., deleting communications) when the drinking behavior is not at odds with their goals and/or values. However, even in these instances, the unique contribution of cellular communications above and beyond other sensing methods is unclear. Some communication features, such as outgoing call duration and the number of outgoing calls emerged in the top 20 important features for detecting current drinking episodes. Conversely, when predicting future drinking episodes, no communication features appeared in the top 20. Other sensing methods, like geolocation and accelerometer data, appeared to be more robustly important for both detection and prediction.</p>
<p>Other practical challenges in collecting call and text message data further limit the feasibility of this sensing method. For example, we obtained participants’ cellular communication data by downloading backups of their communication logs in person during their monthly follow-up visits. However, Apple heavily restricts apps in its app store from accessing call and text message data, making real-time sensing of communications challenging (if not impossible) for IOS users. We conclude that other forms of social interaction characterization (e.g., engineering time spent with supportive contacts from geolocation data) are more worthwhile to pursue in future research.</p>
